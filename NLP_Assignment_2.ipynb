cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days later and an autopsy indicated that she had been sexually assaultedthe police have arrested more than 20 suspects in the case and investigators said on wednesday that one had admitted to kidnapping and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for

stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts and celebrities called for him to be firedif a top police officer

crimesshireen mazari the minister for human rights in prime minister imran khans cabinet condemned the comments by the police chief who serves in a province that is controlled by mr khans governing party nothing can ever rationalize the crime of rape she wrote on twitter that is itdr mazari did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on fridayreacting to both cases mr khan said in a series of tweets on thursday that officials would bring the perpetrators to justice such brutality and bestiality cannot be allowed in any civilized society mr khan saidpakistan ranks 147th out of

the netherlands the index measures the prevalence of child labor and rates of mortality and malnutrition among other criteriapakistans consistently poor ranking in the survey proves that policymakers

englishlanguage daily in pakistansome sexual assault cases in the country have led to calls for a national reckoningin 2015 pakistan was rocked by accusations that at least 280 children under the age

muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people surrounded the local police station and accused officers of neglectthere are signs that the country is moving to tackle the issueunder legislation that parliament passed in march anyone who kidnaps rapes or murders a minor can face life imprisonment or the

not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have

soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the

problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both Muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the Prophet S

they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have

inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had decided then he would play by their rulesso one morning he went to a camp of hizbiislami a pashtunheavy militia and sought out an acquaintance i want to do jihad he announcedthe man broke into a broad

other forms of fitna and again you are forgetting that we are talking about qadianis or ahmedis who does not consider Prophet S A W as last prophet and have their own holy books on which they put the label of islam and same mirza ghulam has said many disrespecting stuff about our mother the wifes of Prophet S A W and many other prophets of Allah and they consider us non muslims and you are saying something that does not make any sense you are missing the basic that what makes a person a muslim Shadah of believing on Allah and his last Prophet S A W this is the base and anyone who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both Muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the Prophet S A W and prominent scholars of all time and they day Prophet S A W decalred his Prophet hood all those following other religions became non muslims and Muslims is specific word which defines a particular thing

i will say what many indian muslims seem to want to say but are afraid of being labeled as terrorists since the indianleft has already tried to label me as a hindootuah should not it be hinduviyat so i guess i can return to neutrality by engaging in some muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being

was the second highly disgusting rape that has come out of the region with the other being a frenchpakistani woman being gangraped on lahore highwaynon paywall link do not bother going to rpakistan to

outpouring of rage in a country that critics say has a toxic culture surrounding sexual assaults and child abusehashtags calling for justice for the victims have been shared widely on social media by ordinary people opposition politicians and highprofile athletes including shan masood a member of pakistans national cricket teamwe cannot lose our youth to such disgusting and inhuman acts mr masood wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days later and an autopsy indicated that she had been sexually assaultedthe police have arrested more than 20 suspects in the case and investigators said on wednesday that one had admitted to kidnapping and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for assistance two men both believed to be in their 30s broke the driversside window with sticks and stones and dragged her and her children off the roadthe woman was raped multiple times and the men stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts

by the kidsrights foundation a research and advocacy group in the netherlands the index measures the prevalence of child labor and rates of mortality and malnutrition among other criteriapakistans consistently poor ranking in the survey proves that policymakers and state machinery in pakistan have utterly ignored welfare and rights of children ms aziz the opposition lawmaker and childrens rights advocate wrote last year in the news international a major englishlanguage daily in pakistansome sexual assault cases in the country have led to calls for a national reckoningin 2015 pakistan was rocked by accusations that at least 280 children under the age of 14 in villages in eastern punjab province had been subjected to sexual abuse by a gang of 15 men who made videos to extort money from the children and their parentsmore recently the case of muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people surrounded the local police station and accused officers of neglectthere are signs that the country is moving to tackle the issueunder legislation that parliament passed in march anyone who kidnaps

a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk', 'its open to interpretation of course but part 3 states that afghan soil will not be uses to attack the us and its allies i believe that you would agree that the nation of afghanistan is classed as a us ally right 3after the announcement of guarantees for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and timelinein the presence of international witnesses and guarantees and the announcement in the presence of international witnesses that afghan soil will not be used against the security of the united states and its allies the islamic emirate of afghanistan which is not recognized by the united states as a state and is known as the taliban will start intraafghan negotiations with afghan sides on march 10 2020 which corresponds to rajab 15 1441 on the hijri lunar calendar and hoot 20 1398 on the hijri solar calendar', 'from what i gather as an outsider the government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated unless the talibs get some serious supervision and training from the russians or isi etc that helicopter will be more dangerous to themselves than anybody they might try to use it against and sniper rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse comes to worst all massoud and saleh have to do is collapse the entryway into the valleythe talibs have no heavy engineering equipment to clear the way like the soviets didit may be a different conflict but the more things change the more they stay the same', 'cus the resources they have to commit is long term however indian economy was on the negative for quite a while i do not think they would would be welcoming of such idea when pandemic and other crisis are still haunting them also do not forget taliban now has stateoftheart us military hardware and in good numbers indians going there have to be ready to become the casualty in good numbers if they wish to fightthe fight has to be taken by a global power and india is still not their yet', 'the army you trained and equipped to fight collapsed in days when you pulled its support literally thousands of americas had to flee through the gauntlet to the airport being beaten on the way some were shot thousands did not make it out and remain thereyour allies left behind are being executed and those that made it to the airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two decades because in isolation they do not work the definition of insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a different result', 'catholic here our religions have a long history with regard the idea of an ummah in my opinion just wondering and trying to understand by better educating myself here who gets to decide who restablishes the caliphate as it concerns the ummah more specifically is there an islamic tradition considered equally sacred as the quran that is used to interpret who rightfully establishes the caliphate among the ummah otherwise if not how is this any different than a protestant who would use the bible as their sole rule of faith and authority and using their own traditions and interpretations start a new churchummah thinking they are restablishing an equivilent caliphate or something like that', 'the difference is vietnam was a legitimate internal dispute that evolved organically among the people and we just hopped in on to help out one side after we started leaving the south still believed in the ideals of democracy building and continued to fight for itin afghanistan we built an artificial opposition force out of people who were just trying to cash in on us dollars and did not really care about the democracy we were creating as soon as it became clear we were really leaving every leader in the country started cutting backroom deals with the talib to save themselves and get a piece in the new administration', 'people throw this term around a lot and its wrong if a person is born abroad lives a certain lifestyle speaks and most importantly hears everyone around him her speak a certain language is used to eating a certain cuisine is used to having facilities is not used to your culture that person is not a burger he or she has lived their whole life that way and cannot change or fall within our cultural expectations all of a sudden A half pakistani half white youtuber said that she got called burger because she just asked her friend not to throw her trash wrapper down on the ground and she was called a burger for it they just love throwing words like burger or simp etc', 'only 2000 years of history but no ones perfect i guess what is more i have literally modeled the geopolitics of the region throughout its history the rural urbandivide silk road commerce rural agricultural techniques and lifestylecentral asia has been an especially good example of the urban rural divide for thousands of years because its simultaneously a place that did not produce a lot of surpluses in agriculture outside of a few select locations but also able to skim off great wealth from the silk road in urban centers not to mention it was adjacent the steppe and subject to steppe tribal invasionfeel free to make more assumptions though', 'if i want to do something i can do it i may or may not succeed but i can try how is

under american leadership than under the talibans i am not asking in an attempt to justify what we did i am still mad at my government about that but its not like i have much decisional power were

america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan and that the united states

even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around will gain a foothold among the power vacuum as they do everywhere postus military action', 'years ago we had only newspapers tv or radios and to making money were to go with the flow reported what the

weak you can be right i may have a weak faith and I am not a 100 percent practicing Muslim but the Religion of Islam will overcome all these fitnah with or without me I am not doing any favor to Allah

know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree

saw the mujahideen soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had decided then he would play by their rulesso one morning he went to a camp of hizbiislami a pashtunheavy militia and sought out an acquaintance i want

as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both Muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the Prophet S A W and prominent scholars of all time and they day Prophet S A W decalred his Prophet hood all those following other religions became non muslims

not good but in many cases some of which i mentioned they are better then the previous goverment but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are backi mean sure alot of things have gone downhill but as i mentioned above there are some cases in which a taliban rule is better and some cases in which a taliban rule was worse then the previous goverment the current humanitarian crisis is there because of the us for causing it and because of the taliban for not doing what the us says its kind off the fault of both to be honest but more of the us for not letting in and not legitimizingthe taliban and for women in big cities where afghanistan kind of got more modern yes things are worse for women there but in rural afghanistan not much

muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations

territorial integrity afghanistan has a long way to go to reach an iranian standard of living i cannot envision something like this in afghanistan any time soon for example sadly i am not sure at all what the way forward economically is for afghanistan they are going to need ongoing foreign aid and remittances from the afghan diasporaedits', 'this is so enheartening to see and it shows the taliban are in a tough spot right now they have to be careful they are not seen as the new occupation from outside after the nato left that is why they do all these pr to appear moderate and everything right now they probably would not be able to violently suppress the population if they would turn against them especially with the news now the vice president is still willing to fight with 10000 soldiers western nations should support him with intelligence and air forces', 'whatever name you want to call it its just a vehicle for achieving a global police military state with the elites owning everything and the rest just being slaves they already have everything but they are not even human and will never stop they want mass depopulation global microchip id for everyone digital currency a world where AI decides everything no freedoms not even of thought China is the next america for the nwo 5G and AI is the final step in the mark of the beast these people do not care for nationalities that is just a cover', 'are you really comparing a practice that happened hundreds of years ago to present day and even if 15 year olds could get married nowadays the taliban is forcing them to get married which is completely haram and can constitute as rape you are quite literally a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting and sorry excuse of a human beingno mate women are not property you cannot take them especially if its against their will that plus this is not a war in the islamic sense the taliban murder innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period', 'yes people have no idea how ruthless the isis he actually is they are so hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an enemy that does not care for anyone']\n",

wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days

and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for assistance two men both believed to be in their 30s broke the driversside window with sticks and stones and dragged her and her children off the roadthe woman was raped multiple times and the men stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts

from the children and their parentsmore recently the case of muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people

a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk', 'its open to interpretation of course but part 3 states that afghan soil will not be uses to attack the us and its allies i believe that you would agree that the nation of afghanistan is classed as a us ally right 3after the announcement of guarantees for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and timelinein the presence of international witnesses and guarantees and the announcement in the presence of international witnesses that afghan soil will not be used against the security of the united states and its allies the islamic emirate of afghanistan which is not recognized by the united states as a state and is known as the taliban will start intraafghan negotiations with afghan sides on march 10 2020 which corresponds to rajab 15 1441 on the hijri lunar calendar and hoot 20 1398 on the hijri solar calendar', 'from what i gather as an outsider the government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated unless the talibs get some serious supervision and training from the russians or isi etc that helicopter will be more dangerous to themselves than anybody they might try to use it against and sniper rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse comes to worst all massoud and saleh have to do is collapse the entryway into the valleythe talibs have no heavy engineering equipment to clear the way like the soviets didit may be a different conflict but the more things change the more they stay the same', 'the army you trained and equipped to fight collapsed in days when you pulled its support literally thousands of americas had to flee through the gauntlet to the airport being beaten on the way some were shot thousands did not make it out and remain thereyour allies left behind are being executed and those that made it to the airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two decades because in isolation they do not work the definition of insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a different result', 'catholic here our religions have a long history with regard the idea of an ummah in my opinion just wondering and trying to understand by better educating myself here who gets to decide who restablishes the caliphate as it concerns the ummah more specifically is there an islamic tradition considered equally sacred as the quran that is used to interpret who rightfully establishes the caliphate among the ummah otherwise if not how is this any different than a protestant who would use the bible as their sole rule of faith and authority and using their own traditions and interpretations start a new churchummah thinking they are restablishing an equivilent caliphate or something like that', 'the difference is vietnam was a legitimate internal dispute that evolved organically among the people and we just hopped in on to help out one side after we started leaving the south still believed in the ideals of democracy building and continued to fight for itin afghanistan we built an artificial opposition force out of people who were just trying to cash in on us dollars and did not really care about the democracy we were creating as soon as it became clear we were really leaving every leader in the country started cutting backroom deals with the talib to save themselves and get a piece in the new administration', 'people throw this term around a lot and its wrong if a person is born abroad lives a certain lifestyle speaks and most importantly hears everyone around him her speak a certain language is used to eating a certain cuisine is used to having facilities is not used to your culture that person is not a burger he or she has lived their whole life that way and cannot change or fall within our cultural expectations all of a sudden A half pakistani half white youtuber said that she got called burger because she just asked her friend not to throw her trash wrapper down on the ground and she was called a burger for it they just love throwing words like burger or simp etc', 'only 2000 years of history but no ones perfect i guess what is more i have literally modeled the geopolitics of the region throughout its history the rural urbandivide silk road commerce rural agricultural techniques and lifestylecentral asia has been an especially good example of the urban rural divide for thousands of years because its simultaneously a place that did not produce a lot of surpluses in agriculture outside of a few select locations but also able to skim off great wealth from the silk road in urban centers not to mention it was adjacent the steppe and subject to steppe tribal invasionfeel free to make more assumptions though', 'a taliban rule is horrible too of course but a us invasion is as terribledont get me wrong i agree with what you said but i am curious was not it better under american leadership than under the talibans i am not asking in an attempt to justify what we did i am still mad at my government about that but its not like i have much decisional power were trying to change things

than 3000 years ago it was a greek nation a lot has changed it was not just a static place of dueling tribes for its entire history proof the mongols absolutely took afghanistanproof the romans never tried to take it their borders never went further east than modern iraqthe russians could not take afghanistan that is true but arguably america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan and that the united states at best contributed to their founding indirectly by being successful in defeating the soviets', 'they are free from religion is what they mean france is generally not a religious country anymore with many of its population not being affiliated to any religion anymore and again the only thing that is banned is the burka and even the majority of the muslim population here do not seem bother by it because the burka was not used here only by radicals and recent converts who by the time were only like 2000 women plus safety reasons and because the even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around will gain a foothold among the power vacuum as they do everywhere postus

under the queens peace is so that is why they can and i cannot legally speaking the mens rea you are waffling on about is overridden by amendments to the immigration act it used to be that you cannot help them for gain but now there have been many cases in which there has been persecution against people in my town that i know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree with andor legislation is there saying one thing it does not mean someone will not and is not prosecuted for doing so', 'good point i really did not follow the conflict closely for a long time and i still do not know the hard facts about what the different eras

giving police officers paid leave is more that speed imoand yes that is what i was getting at when i said the us was facing extinction and yes for better or worse but from the perspective of the people running the country during the cold war it was certainly for worse and for 99 of the country at the time it was for worse so with that said it only makes sense that the us would fund a proxy

taliban due to the atrocities he saw the mujahideen soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war

muslim Shadah of believing on Allah and his last Prophet S A W this is the base and anyone who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both Muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the Prophet S A W and prominent scholars of all time and they day Prophet S A W decalred his Prophet hood all those

taliban were not good marriage prospects the only way they were ever going to get a woman was with a gun they could commit all manner of crimes ranging from rapes including children thefts murders and

taliban provide more security plus now people are not in fear of getting drone striked in some places now there still are alot of downsides of the taliban rule its not good but in many cases some of which i mentioned they are better then the previous goverment but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are backi mean sure alot of things have gone downhill but as i mentioned above there are some cases in which a taliban rule is better and some cases in which a taliban rule was worse then the previous goverment the current humanitarian crisis is there because of the us for causing it and because of the taliban for not doing what the us says its kind off the fault of both to be honest but more of the us for not letting in and not legitimizingthe taliban and for women in big cities where afghanistan kind of got more modern yes things are worse for women there but in rural afghanistan not much has changed considering that there

dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations that aim to adopt innovations by incorporating them into their own frameworks instead of imposing western culture onto traditional peoples sound familiar', 'can someone explain why turkey seems to do this pretty obvious protaliban shillingthey release

leading the movement to dismantle the iron curtain if you are seriously not going to give reagan credit for that you are just a disingenuous reagan haterthe us is always one president away from

withdraw and let the nazi regime continue its terrors of course not it was waged to oppose the taliban al qaeda ideologies and the threat emanating from thegermany did not have an active and wellorganized insurgency constantly fighting us for 20 years if it did i would not be surprised if we withdrew from germany also we did not go to war with germany because of the holocaust or nazi war

security for us and help escort some of those people to the airport i would not say the last month was really a show of strength from the taliban we have all seen the videos of them playing army they are pretty much as well trained as the average american you all qaeda member which is truly pathetic we held them at bay with a fraction of the fighting force took a fraction of the casualties they did and left the country in a completely defendable state which the ana squanderedbut yeah you are right dude sorry', 'yea apparently they want to talk but his demands are pretty clear and also steep

less about pakistans beef with india the kind of thinking espoused in your post is the reason pakistan will never treat or respect afghanistan as a soverign nation', 'We regard the word acknowledge as being the word that is determinative for the YOU S The Taiwan Relations Act specifies that Taiwan includes as the context may require the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores the people on those islands corporations and other entities and associations created or organized under the laws applied on those islands and the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1 1979 and any successor governing authorities including political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities thereof', 'The Taliban were a very staunch followers and took the words to the T US Russia and now China know this very well that when someone who practices religion as if it is the only thing that matters is given power they will be able to hold their influence and keep other countries in check using the local zealot to rule the people with the fear that foreigners are going to destroy their culture because that is what any religious leader cares about upholding the religious culture or whatever they think the culture is', 'I get if people are leaving due to xenophobia and it is not cool but the ones that end up bitter and resentful and end up turning their back on China so to speak like certain Youtubers that are well known for saying shit about China long after they left the country are not likely to be in the category of people that you mention so I guess what I am saying is that the people who decide to stay and stick it out and make a contribution to the country are the ones that will be valued by Chinese society vs the ones who just went there to make a quick buck as an ESL teacher not that there is anything wrong with that but they do not really have a good reputation these days', 'last post because you are a very irritating individual and its not my job to teach youespecially when you are paying 9000 a year yet you are still wrong loli do not know why you are waffling on about maritime law you said you cannot help people struggling in the crossing and if you do you will be arrested there is the social action responsibility and heroism act 2015 to support honest good samaritan rescue to those in need it clearly is not in the public interest to prosecute those genuinely trying to save life nor is there any mens rea which is needed to complete an offenceside note that i am not racist you are just wrong and are throwing whatever baseless accusations you can at me i suppose i am homophobic and a nazi as well yawn and i am sure if you were in charge you would fix all the worlds problems good luck with your third year you hero staple that bsc hons to your forehead', 'dude i have not even created the gofundme yet i am not glued to my laptop i have never even done a gofundme in my life but i thought someone here would have experience with that right now i have been focused on seeing if i can get an aircraft and making sure this plan is viable only then will we have something we can work with i am not going to ask for anyones money until everything is concrete everything will be 100 transparent since its our money you can create the gofundme and pay for it for all i care you can even come if you think its a scam just be constructive please', 'this is so enheartening to see and it shows the taliban are in a tough spot right now they have to be careful they are not seen as the new occupation from outside after the nato left that is why they do all these pr to appear moderate and everything right now they probably would not be able to violently suppress the population if they would turn against them especially with the news now the vice president is still willing to fight with 10000 soldiers western nations should support him with intelligence and air forces', 'are you really comparing a practice that happened hundreds of years ago to present day and even if 15 year olds could get married nowadays the taliban is forcing them to get married which is completely haram and can constitute as rape you are quite literally a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting and sorry excuse of a human beingno mate women are not property you cannot take them especially if its against their will that plus this is not a war in the islamic sense the taliban murder innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period', 'yes people have no idea how ruthless the isis he actually is they are so hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an enemy that does not care for anyone']\n",
