changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was

soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the

younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today

they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had decided then he would play by their rulesso one morning he went to a camp of hizbiislami a pashtunheavy militia and sought out an acquaintance i want to do jihad he announcedthe man broke into a broad

label of islam and same mirza ghulam has said many disrespecting stuff about our mother the wifes of prophet s a w and many other prophets of allah and they consider us non muslims and you are saying something that does not make any sense you are missing the basic that what makes a person a muslim shadah of believing on allah and his last prophet s a w this is the base and anyone who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the prophet s a w and

i will say what many indian muslims seem to want to say but are afraid of being labeled as terrorists since the indianleft has already tried to label me as a hindootuah should not it be hinduviyat so i guess i can return to neutrality by engaging in some muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being

day ago about 400 men raped and assaulted a woman in lahore punjab in open public in front of the minar e pakistan our version of the washington monument the video of it is extremely horrifying this was the second highly disgusting rape that has come out of the region with the other being a frenchpakistani woman being gangraped on lahore highwaynon paywall link do not bother going to rpakistan to see it it hates religious minorities such as ahmedis and is a shithole of racism and xenophobia against afghans and even their own ethnicities balochis and sindhis they even had to delete many comments supporting the rape and defending and excusing their people who committed itislamabad pakistan a 5yearold girl in southern pakistan was raped hit on the head and set on fire five days later a woman in the countrys east was dragged from her car and sexually assaulted on a highway in front of her childrenthe two episodes which occurred hundreds of miles apart have prompted protests and an outpouring of rage in a country that critics say has a toxic culture surrounding sexual assaults and child abusehashtags calling for justice for the victims have been shared widely on social media by ordinary people opposition politicians and highprofile athletes including shan masood a member of pakistans national cricket teamwe cannot lose our youth to such disgusting and inhuman acts mr masood wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said

a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk', 'its open to interpretation of course but part 3 states that afghan soil

government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated

rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse

airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two

entire history proof the mongols absolutely took afghanistanproof the romans never tried to take it their borders never went further east than modern iraqthe russians could not take afghanistan that is true but arguably america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan

even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around

not governed by the same law as i a citizen under the queens peace is so that is why they can and i cannot legally speaking the mens rea you are waffling on about is overridden by amendments to the immigration act it used to be that you cannot help them for gain but now there have been many cases in which there has been persecution against people in my town that i know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree with andor

when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had

who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no

of the worst foreign policy presidents ever but then regan came in and was arguably one of their best modern foreign policy presidents and helped dissolve the soviet unionmore like two events that are more than a decade apart and have nothing to do with oneanother the us showed itself far far worse here than in saigon and it is up against a power block that is much stronger than the soviet union

alone one of the best is not only false it is borderline malicious considering what reagan did to the middle class in the us separate from foreign policy i know but even then i would argue that his

the canadian government schools for first nationals the united states american civil war and so on while these two peoples comments are not as extreme as what the people in afghanistan are facing you are clearly ignoring or not educated about christian or political extremism in american politics i would advise you to look up the kkk the bombings of southern black churches in the united states in the 1960s extremist groups on the far left and far right and mass shootings that have interrupted civilians lives in schools work places and other public the united states government also has medical

indianleft has already tried to label me as a hindootuah should not it be hinduviyat so i guess i can return to neutrality by engaging in some muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations that aim to adopt innovations by incorporating them into their own frameworks instead of imposing western culture onto traditional peoples sound familiar', 'the old guys prefer india over china but the new gen prefer china because they all see china as this very rich very developed country from media only if they saw the other parts fo china their view would be different and see india as bully it all started because of economic blockade of nepal by india around 2014 i think due to low treatment of madhesi in terai regions by nepali government and at that time the chinese government gave them gas and food which swooned nepali towards china and the recent lipulekh land encroachment which nepali government used that topic to fuel the hatred towards india', 'that is what we do not understand real love will be a form of imitation.That person

i do not expect the taliban regime to last for long and them losing soo much in a short period', 'the rhetoric that we funded and supported a bunch of terrorists in the middle east that went on to create the taliban and al queda is wrong and misleading at the minimum and i already stated that i know the us funded mujahideen factions the fact this person i replied to had no idea what i was talking about was my point there is a major rhetoric about this point in history that is much more complicated than how its set out to be the mujahideen factions we funded also fought and were beaten by the talibanshould the us have ever funded any in the first place maybe not but its much more complicated than this idea that the taliban al queda is our personal creation that we created so we could fight them with the military industrial complex', 'twanu mola puchy', 'parking ko lagi banako space cha jasma illegally business garirako cha ani bike haru chai road side ma park garnu parya cha

does not mean they want the taliban taliban and their skewed version of islam shariah law is not what they want for sure there is a small but gross minority that support the taliban and of course they are supported by pk but the majority do not support it i am hearing so many things right now and its conflicting also so it is very hard to navigate what is going on as it happened so fast all i want is lasting peace for my country and people what ever gives us that is what i want and i am sure they would want back home too', 'veut rien dire', 'khulna flag a sylized version of the letter kha

ba i am from kerala and i am not familiar with bangladeshi culture though it remains my favorite nation along with the philippines feel free to correct me if some of these flags seem offensive or if you consider it cultural appropriation', 'the requirement of wearing a burqa in public aligns with salafi ideas that women have to cover their face in islam as well compared to other muslims who believe that the face is not required to be covered the idea that women should speak quietly in public to avoid others hearing their voice is based on the idea that a womans voice is also awrah women being prevented from travelling or even essentially appearing publicly without a mahram the idea that entertainment and recreation is haram because it distracts from prayer and focus on islam while other muslim authorities also hold similar views entertainment and recreation are not completely banned and are allowed so long as they do not promote ideas that go against islamic norms and values the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas because of possible idolatry aligns with the actions that wahhabis have taken although its important to note not all salafis are wahhabist like the demolishing of various historical sites in saudi arabia the ban on women working sort of aligns with the salafi ideal that women should not be out working and making unnecessary contact with nonmahram men unless absolutely necessary the taliban take this to the next extreme by banning all women from work and failing to acknowledge those that had to work to meet the bare minimums for their families or were the sole breadwinners the ruling behind beards being mandatory and to not shave them while not specific to salafi ideology alone id say out of all the muslim groups they adhere to it the most strongly', 'last post because you are a very irritating individual and its not my job to teach youespecially when you are paying 9000 a year yet you are still wrong loli do not know why you are waffling on about maritime law you said you cannot help people struggling in the crossing and if you do you will be arrested there is the social action responsibility and heroism act 2015 to support honest good samaritan rescue to those in need it clearly is not in the public interest to prosecute those genuinely trying to save life nor is there any mens rea which is needed to complete an offenceside note that i am not racist you are just wrong and are throwing whatever baseless accusations you can at me i suppose i am homophobic and a nazi as well yawn and i am sure if you were in charge you would fix all the worlds problems good luck with your third year you hero staple that bsc hons to your forehead', 'are you really comparing a practice that happened hundreds of years ago to present day and even if 15 year olds could get married nowadays the taliban is forcing them to get married which is completely haram and can constitute as rape you are quite literally a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting and sorry excuse of a human beingno mate women are not property you cannot take them especially if its against their will that plus this is not a war in the islamic sense the taliban murder innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period', 'yes people have no idea how ruthless the isis he actually is they are so hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an enemy that does not care for anyone', 'twanu mola puchy']\n",

was the second highly disgusting rape that has come out of the region with the other being a frenchpakistani woman being gangraped on lahore highwaynon paywall link do not bother going to rpakistan to

woman in the countrys east was dragged from her car and sexually assaulted on a highway in front of her childrenthe two episodes which occurred hundreds of miles apart have prompted protests and an outpouring of rage in a country that critics say has a toxic culture surrounding sexual assaults and child abusehashtags calling for justice for the victims have been shared widely on social media by ordinary people opposition politicians and highprofile athletes including shan masood a member of pakistans national cricket teamwe cannot lose our youth to such disgusting and inhuman acts mr masood wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days later and an autopsy indicated that she had been sexually assaultedthe police have arrested more than 20 suspects in the case and investigators said on wednesday that one had admitted to kidnapping and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for assistance two men both believed to be in their 30s broke the driversside window with sticks and stones and dragged her and her children off the roadthe woman was raped multiple times and the men stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts

rights advocate wrote last year in the news international a major englishlanguage daily in pakistansome sexual assault cases in the country have led to calls for a national reckoningin 2015 pakistan was rocked by accusations that at least 280 children under the age of 14 in villages in eastern punjab province had been subjected to sexual abuse by a gang of 15 men who made videos to extort money from the children and their parentsmore recently the case of muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people surrounded the local police station and accused officers of neglectthere are signs that the country is moving to tackle the issueunder legislation that parliament passed in march anyone who kidnaps

governor in term of proviso to clause 4 of article 239AA of the constitution shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified by a general or special order by lieutenant governor', 'right but a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk', 'its open to interpretation of course but part 3 states that afghan soil will not be uses to attack the us and its allies i believe that you would agree that the nation of afghanistan is classed as a us ally right 3after the announcement of guarantees for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and timelinein the presence of international witnesses and guarantees and the announcement in the presence of international witnesses that afghan soil will not be used against the security of the united states and its allies the islamic emirate of afghanistan which is not recognized by the united states as a state and is known as the taliban will start intraafghan negotiations with afghan sides on march 10 2020 which corresponds to rajab 15 1441 on the hijri lunar calendar and hoot 20 1398 on the hijri solar calendar', 'from what i gather as an outsider the government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated unless the talibs get some serious supervision and training from the russians or isi etc that helicopter will be more dangerous to themselves than anybody they might try to use it against and sniper rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse comes to worst all massoud and saleh have to do is collapse the entryway into the valleythe talibs have no heavy engineering equipment to clear the way like the soviets didit may be a different conflict but the more things change the more they stay the same', 'cus the resources they have to commit is long term however indian economy was on the negative for quite a while i do not think they would would be welcoming of such idea when pandemic and other crisis are still haunting them also do not forget taliban now has stateoftheart us military hardware and in good numbers indians going there have to be ready to become the casualty in good numbers if they wish to fightthe fight has to be taken by a global power and india is still not their yet', 'the army you trained and equipped to fight collapsed in days when you pulled its support literally thousands of americas had to flee through the gauntlet to the airport being beaten on the way some were shot thousands did not make it out and remain thereyour allies left behind are being executed and those that made it to the airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two decades because in isolation they do not work the definition of insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a different result', 'catholic here our religions have a long history with regard the idea of an ummah in my opinion just wondering and trying to understand by better educating myself here who gets to decide who restablishes the caliphate as it concerns the ummah more specifically is there an islamic tradition considered equally sacred as the quran that is used to interpret who rightfully establishes the caliphate among the ummah otherwise if not how is this any different than a protestant who would use the bible as their sole rule of faith and authority and using their own traditions and interpretations start a new churchummah thinking they are restablishing an equivilent caliphate or something like that', 'the difference is vietnam was a legitimate internal dispute that evolved organically among the people and we just hopped in on to help out one side after we started leaving the south still believed in the ideals of democracy building and continued to fight for itin afghanistan we built an artificial opposition force out of people who were just trying to cash in on us dollars and did not really care about the democracy we were creating as soon as it became clear we were really leaving every leader in the country started cutting backroom deals with the talib to save themselves and get a piece in the new administration', 'people throw this term around a lot and its wrong if a person is born abroad lives a certain lifestyle speaks and most importantly hears everyone around him her speak a certain language is used to eating a certain cuisine is used to having facilities is not used to your culture that person is not a burger he or she has lived their whole life that way and cannot change or fall within our cultural expectations all of a sudden a half pakistani half white youtuber said that she got called burger because she just asked her friend not to throw her trash wrapper down on the ground and she was called a burger for

than 3000 years ago it was a greek nation a lot has changed it was not just a static place of dueling tribes for its entire history proof the mongols absolutely took afghanistanproof the romans never tried to take it their borders never went further east than modern iraqthe russians could not take afghanistan that is true but arguably america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan and that the united states at best contributed to their founding indirectly by being successful in defeating the soviets', 'they are free from religion is what they mean france is generally not a religious country anymore with many of its population not being affiliated to any religion anymore and again the only thing that is banned is the burka and even the majority of the muslim population here do not seem bother by it because the burka was not used here only by radicals and recent converts who by the time were only like 2000 women plus safety reasons and because the even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around will gain a foothold among the power vacuum as they do everywhere postus

help them for gain but now there have been many cases in which there has been persecution against people in my town that i know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree with andor legislation is there saying one thing it does not

nothing to stop it other than giving police officers paid leave is more that speed imoand yes that is what i was getting at when i said the us was facing extinction and yes for better or worse but from the perspective of the people running the country during the cold war it was certainly for worse and for 99 of the country at the time it was for worse so with that said it only makes sense that

mullah cable akbar gul in the book no good men among the living it was interesting to see how he joined the taliban due to the atrocities he saw the mujahideen soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had decided then he would play by

label of islam and same mirza ghulam has said many disrespecting stuff about our mother the wifes of prophet s a w and many other prophets of allah and they consider us non muslims and you are saying

believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the prophet s a w and

i have seen many senior ranking officers and diplomats of india who says if iran allow us a sustainable route to afghanistan we would have provided them air support even our oldest plans like a jaguar

stop supporting talib might besides that afghans are on their own the unfortunate truth is the world is tired of helping or hearing about afghanistan they are fine watching afghans drown while

does not the only people who gain ground over the long term are the terrorists themselves and its bigger than just pakistan there is a reason lots of indians go off to the gulf states to work but come back radicalized and this suits the hindu nationalists too since it gives them rallying cries and excuses for power expansions the way this conflict will unfold is not going to be about conquering lands but about internal strife between hindu fascists and muslim salafists that is going to destabilize the country meanwhile further privatization of everything and the dysfunction of the government will exacerbate the whole thing as there will be no safety net or state force to prevent the violence and the only way to have a nice life will be to try to live in gated areas in the metros and never

they do not even know the kalimah on of the educated hot shot taliban said that panjshiri are not muslim lol can you believe that he also said if your not a taliban muslim then your not muslim you see taliban define islam in their own eyes as being something totally different than what it actually is they are equating their islam to gods words which is shirk is that islam if they do not know jack they are not the enforcers of islam they are puppets using islams name to commit crimes i am thankful to allah that i know the difference between right and wrong and if a taliban crosses my path its his end of days i have zero sympathy for someone that uses islam in a derogatory way our of context and make up their own version which is shirk islam is a religion of peace taliban are antipeace

killed over 200 people including children and since the taliban takeover several reports from media outlets like bbc and al jazeera have shown how till date pakistan has taken in the most afghan

young men with wives most of the young men in the taliban were not good marriage prospects the only way they were ever going to get a woman was with a gun they could commit all manner of crimes ranging from rapes including children thefts murders and generally get away with it as long as their victims were not family members of other taliban which is why hazaras and other minority groups

would kill you for even the smallest of things now the taliban provide more security plus now people are not in fear of getting drone striked in some places now there still are alot of downsides of the taliban rule its not good but in many cases some of which i mentioned they are better then the previous goverment but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are backi mean sure alot of things have gone downhill but as i mentioned above there are some cases in which a taliban rule is better and some cases in which a taliban rule was worse then the previous goverment the current humanitarian crisis is there because of the us for causing it and because of the taliban for not doing what the us says its kind off the fault of both

and creation of two societies the canadian government schools for first nationals the united states american civil war and so on while these two peoples comments are not as extreme as what the people

muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations that aim to adopt innovations by incorporating them into their own frameworks instead of imposing western culture onto traditional peoples sound familiar', 'can someone explain why turkey seems to do

long after they left the country are not likely to be in the category of people that you mention so i guess what i am saying is that the people who decide to stay and stick it out and make a contribution to the country are the ones that will be valued by chinese society vs the ones who just went there to make a quick buck as an esl teacher not that there is anything wrong with that but they do not really have a good reputation these days', 'last post because you are a very irritating individual and its not my job to teach youespecially when you are paying 9000 a year yet you are still wrong loli do not know why you are waffling on about maritime law you said you cannot help people struggling in the crossing and if you do you will be arrested there is the social action responsibility and heroism act 2015 to support honest good samaritan rescue to those in need it clearly is not in the public interest to prosecute those genuinely trying to save life nor is there any mens rea which is needed to complete an offenceside note that i am not racist you are just wrong and are throwing whatever baseless accusations you can at me i suppose i am homophobic and a nazi as well yawn and i am sure if you were in charge you would fix all the worlds problems good luck with your third year you hero staple that bsc hons to your forehead', 'historically catholics are numbered among the most important scientists of all time including rene descartes who discovered analytic geometry and the laws of refraction blaise pascal inventor of the adding machine hydraulic press and the mathematical theory of probabilities augustinian priest gregor mendel who founded modern genetics louis pasteur founder of microbiology and creator of the first vaccine for rabies and anthrax and cleric nicolaus copernicus who first developed scientifically the view that the earth rotated around the sun', 'after the us made a deal with taliban the us pressured afghan government to release thousands of taliban prisoners those released taliban came back and fought against afghan army at the same time us and nato started withdrawal and and left afghans alone can that explain to you why taliban are winning if not taliban have strong support of pakistan that is a nuclear power will than explain why taliban are winning i can send you resources to prove all of these points', 'when they do that they get branded as traitors it is a very shitty thing to say that to someone who wanted to do something but was either ridiculed or given zero attention or maybe got removed from history because of being a ahmadi or some other minor religion in pakistan pakistanis will not care about people who take stand against corruption and problems but when they leave the country because no one else gives a shit they will be called traitors for life', 'dude i have not even created the gofundme yet i am not glued to my laptop i have never even done a gofundme in my life but i thought someone here would have experience with that right now i have been focused on seeing if i can get an aircraft and making sure this plan is viable only then will we have something we can work with i am not going to ask for anyones money until everything is concrete everything will be 100 transparent since its our money you can create the gofundme and pay for it for all i care you can even come if you think its a scam just be constructive please', 'this is so enheartening to see and it shows the taliban are in a tough spot right now they have to be careful they are not seen as the new occupation from outside after the nato left that is why they do all these pr to appear moderate and everything right now they probably would not be able to violently suppress the population if they would turn against them especially with the news now the vice president is still willing to fight with 10000 soldiers western nations should support him with intelligence and air forces', 'whatever name you want to call it its just a vehicle for achieving a global police military state with the elites owning everything and the rest just being slaves they already have everything but they are not even human and will never stop they want mass depopulation global microchip id for everyone digital currency a world where ai decides everything no freedoms not even of thought china is the next america for the nwo 5G and ai is the final step in the mark of the beast these people do not care for nationalities that is just a cover', 'are you really comparing a practice that happened hundreds of years ago to present day and even if 15 year olds could get married nowadays the taliban is forcing them to get married which is completely haram and can constitute as rape you are quite literally a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting and sorry excuse of a human beingno mate women are not property you cannot take them especially if its against their will that plus this is not a war in the islamic sense the taliban murder innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period', 'yes people have no idea how ruthless the isis he actually is they are so hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an enemy that does not care for anyone']\n",

wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days later and an autopsy indicated that she had been sexually assaultedthe police have arrested more than 20 suspects in the case and investigators said on wednesday that one had admitted to kidnapping and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for assistance two men both believed to be in their 30s broke the driversside window with sticks and stones and dragged her and her children off the roadthe woman was raped multiple times and the men stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts

by the kidsrights foundation a research and advocacy group in the netherlands the index measures the prevalence of child labor and rates of mortality and malnutrition among other criteriapakistans consistently poor ranking in the survey proves that policymakers and state machinery in pakistan have utterly ignored welfare and rights of children ms aziz the opposition lawmaker and childrens rights advocate wrote last year in the news international a major englishlanguage daily in pakistansome sexual assault cases in the country have led to calls for a national reckoningin 2015 pakistan was rocked by accusations that at least 280 children under the age of 14 in villages in eastern punjab province had been subjected to sexual abuse by a gang of 15 men who made videos to extort money from the children and their parentsmore recently the case of muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people surrounded the local police station and accused officers of neglectthere are signs that the country is moving to tackle the issueunder legislation that parliament passed in march anyone who kidnaps

a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk', 'its open to interpretation of course but part 3 states that afghan soil will not be uses to attack the us and its allies i believe that you would agree that the nation of afghanistan is classed as a us ally right 3after the announcement of guarantees for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and timelinein the presence of international witnesses and guarantees and the announcement in the presence of international witnesses that afghan soil will not be used against the security of the united states and its allies the islamic emirate of afghanistan which is not recognized by the united states as a state and is known as the taliban will start intraafghan negotiations with afghan sides on march 10 2020 which corresponds to rajab 15 1441 on the hijri lunar calendar and hoot 20 1398 on the hijri solar calendar', 'from what i gather as an outsider the government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated unless the talibs get some serious supervision and training from the russians or isi etc that helicopter will be more dangerous to themselves than anybody they might try to use it against and sniper rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse comes to worst all massoud and saleh have to do is collapse the entryway into the valleythe talibs have no heavy engineering equipment to clear the way like the soviets didit may be a different conflict but the more things change the more they stay the same', 'the army you trained and equipped to fight collapsed in days when you pulled its support literally thousands of americas had to flee through the gauntlet to the airport being beaten on the way some were shot thousands did not make it out and remain thereyour allies left behind are being executed and those that made it to the airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two decades because in isolation they do not work the definition of insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a different result', 'catholic here our religions have a long history with regard the idea of an ummah in my opinion just wondering and trying to understand by better educating myself here who gets to decide who restablishes the caliphate as it concerns the ummah more specifically is there an islamic tradition considered equally sacred as the quran that is used to interpret who rightfully establishes the caliphate among the ummah otherwise if not how is this any different than a protestant who would use the bible as their sole rule of faith and authority and using their own traditions and interpretations start a new churchummah thinking they are restablishing an equivilent caliphate or something like that', 'the difference is vietnam was a legitimate internal dispute that evolved organically among the people and we just hopped in on to help out one side after we started leaving the south still believed in the ideals of democracy building and continued to fight for itin afghanistan we built an artificial opposition force out of people who were just trying to cash in on us dollars and did not really care about the democracy we were creating as soon as it became clear we were really leaving every leader in the country started cutting backroom deals with the talib to save themselves and get a piece in the new administration', 'people throw this term around a lot and its wrong if a person is born abroad lives a certain lifestyle speaks and most importantly hears everyone around him her speak a certain language is used to eating a certain cuisine is used to having facilities is not used to your culture that person is not a burger he or she has lived their whole life that way and cannot change or fall within our cultural expectations all of a sudden a half pakistani half white youtuber said that she got called burger because she just asked her friend not to throw her trash wrapper down on the ground and she was called a burger for it they just love throwing words like burger or simp etc', 'only 2000 years of history but no ones perfect i guess what is more i have literally modeled the geopolitics of the region throughout its history the rural urbandivide silk road commerce rural agricultural techniques and lifestylecentral asia has been an especially good example of the urban rural divide for thousands of years because its simultaneously a place that did not produce a lot of surpluses in agriculture outside of a few select locations but also able to skim off great wealth from the silk road in urban centers not to mention it was adjacent the steppe and subject to steppe tribal invasionfeel free to make more assumptions though', 'a taliban rule is horrible too of course but a us invasion is as terribledont get me wrong i agree with what you said but i am curious was not it better under american leadership than under the talibans i am not asking in an attempt to justify what we did i am still mad at my government about that but its not like i have much decisional power were trying to change things though but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are back', \"parties to the civil conflict people s republic of china from 1949 People's

than 3000 years ago it was a greek nation a lot has changed it was not just a static place of dueling tribes for its entire history proof the mongols absolutely took afghanistanproof the romans never tried to take it their borders never went further east than modern iraqthe russians could not take afghanistan that is true but arguably america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan and that the united states at best contributed to their founding indirectly by being successful in defeating the soviets', 'they are free from religion is what they mean france is generally not a religious country anymore with many of its population not being affiliated to any religion anymore and again the only thing that is banned is the burka and even the majority of the muslim population here do not seem bother by it because the burka was not used here only by radicals and recent converts who by the time were only like 2000 women plus safety reasons and because the even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around will gain a foothold among the power vacuum as they do everywhere postus

scholars worldwide but in reality teach their own teachings by putting the label of islam on it and regarding my faith being weak you can be right i may have a weak faith and i am not a 100 percent practicing muslim but the religion of islam will overcome all these fitnah with or without me i am not doing any favor to allah by calling a non muslim a non muslim but instead i am favoring myself so

under the queens peace is so that is why they can and i cannot legally speaking the mens rea you are waffling on about is overridden by amendments to the immigration act it used to be that you cannot help them for gain but now there have been many cases in which there has been persecution against people in my town that i know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree with andor legislation is there saying one thing it does not mean someone will not and is not prosecuted for doing so', 'good point i really did not follow the conflict closely for a long time and i still do not know the hard facts about what the different eras

that its just based on what i have seenread over the years its really about the perspective of someone from europe back in the 2000s and first half of the 2010s we really did not hear much about

of the people running the country during the cold war it was certainly for worse and for 99 of the country at the time it was for worse so with that said it only makes sense that the us would fund a

going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war

wifes of prophet s a w and many other prophets of allah and they consider us non muslims and you are saying something that does not make any sense you are missing the basic that what makes a person a muslim shadah of believing on allah and his last prophet s a w this is the base and anyone who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the prophet s a w and prominent scholars of all time and they day prophet s a w decalred his prophet hood all those

when it does not the only people who gain ground over the long term are the terrorists themselves and its bigger than just pakistan there is a reason lots of indians go off to the gulf states to work but come back radicalized and this suits the hindu nationalists too since it gives them rallying cries and excuses for power expansions the way this conflict will unfold is not going to be about conquering lands but about internal strife between hindu fascists and muslim salafists that is going to destabilize the country meanwhile further privatization of everything and the dysfunction of the

ranging from rapes including children thefts murders and generally get away with it as long as their victims were not family members of other taliban which is why hazaras and other minority groups

pakistani forces the most pro sepratist region which is the kech district has had their internet shut down for multiple years now something pakistanis were up in arms for when indian kashmmir has 4g internet cut out for a year punjab is an extremely rich province in pakistan which is why there high anti punjabi sentiment in balochistan it is easy to throw rocks at indian kashmir because your government has effectively brainwashed its people for multiple generations that they deserve the land when it became clear an invasion would not get it the narrative changed to we should give independence aka if i cannot have it no one should only people who legitimately care about oppressed people would not dismiss concerns in baluchistan as biased by the west and india there is a strong

neighbor even at the time of partition india lent pakistan money to help stand itself up pak got plenty of industries too majority in the coastal and punjab area how many industries did pak set up for itself in the last 75 years contrast that with not india but bangladesh which split off pak about 50 years ago bdesh at this point is doing even better than india in many areas if pak wanted to develop anything worthwhile it would have done it by now pakistan has caught up again with india in last 4 years would you please confirm if you are talking about terrorism as an industry pak is clearly doing better than not just india but the rest of the world there', 'are you stupid or what you are foreign secretary has accepted it and if india accepted it in 2015 it would have been

world pakistan and india are nearly same in percapita gdp for most of the time since independence even though pakistan inherited a completely agrarian portion of british india all the industries in

are in similar position infact bangladesh has become better than india yes indias it sector and manufacturing sector is much better positioned thanks to nehru and rajiv gandhi still despite this india

fictitious claim that well only take refugees with university degrees', 'i work for a college and i am trying to come up with a more concrete way to help people especially women escape from afghanistan i was wondering if it would be possible to help people get out by offering them a scholarship to attend college so they qualify for an f1 visa i am wondering if this would actually be a viable strategy logistics wise typically students need to do an entrance interview at a us embassy to get the visa not to mention the even trickier part of traveling out of afghanistan i would like to try and coordinate something with my schools international department but before i do i wanted to see if something like this would even be feasible', 'to be honest i do not really watch afghan tv my parents and inlaws however watch it whole day its mostly just the news some cooking shows and then either turkish or indian shows which have been dubbed in either pashto or dari dubbed language depends on the channel we also have afghan idol talkshows strangely enough a lot of programs are based on music for example male andor female singers would be invited to talk and sing as far as i know they did not really show western shows sometimes they would show a hollywood or bollywood movie which would be dubbed over but you should know that afghanistan has always been an islamic country and quite strict so bare skin legs arms cleavage etc would always be blurred pictures of statues of indian gods which sometimes would be shown in indian shows did used to get blurred most of the times as well these shows are completely gone now there is a turkish show called kurulus osman which is about the start of the ottoman empire the taliban has approved this and it is showing at the moment', 'if anyone literally anyone shows some sort of a will to fight us army generals will put a massive pressure on biden to at least support those fighting the taliban with drones and f16snot necessarily as there is a problem there is no good route into afghanistan for those airstrikes the only good route is the fly over pakistan but that requires pakistans tacit approval meaning we go back to the same status quo of the last 20 years where pakistan is supporting both sidesflying missions out of turkmenistan uzbekistan or tajikistan might be doable but the logistics of that are tricky because it requires russian cooperation on top of that you probably need some kind of understanding with azerbaijan armenia turkey and possibly georgia for overflightnot to mention the us is not going to risk inflaming tensions with the taliban while hkia is surrounded once us personnel is out then maybe but not beforeif not him uk or australia will they are even more pissed off about how us handled the

can bet that if they decide to do what they have already been doing going door to door but on a larger scale and persistently then other countries will get involved again and resistance movements can expect support from countries like france honestly i would not have the balls to go out like these brave people and for good reason sadly i hope the talibs get what is coming to them its a matter of time maybe it will be 5 months 2 years a decade or several decades but at some point they will get oblitirated and i certainly will not she would a tear', 'they do control it but its only been a few

hearing they only have 60k total factions will regroup rise up and challenge them aka civil war upcomingthe taliban have the added burden now of having to govern and govern in a way that will keep the population happy a population that has had 20 yrs of western freedoms a generation that only knows these luxuries and a vastly better quality of life they had prior to the us invasion education jobs

dumb with half knowledge the afghan army is one of the most corrupt in the world they us provided the tech for afghan army but look at the taliban how fast they covered the region without any fight

detachment that was doing inspection work on some construction projects the us was funding thereit was a wartime mission but i never felt so safe anywhere in afghanistan we drove up and down the valley and everywhere people were kind and welcoming we had candy and school supplies for the kids and they were so grateful even for things like pencils and papercontrast that with the burned out hulks of tanks and armored vehicles all over the lower third of the valley even up in the high places they use russian bomb casings as flower pots maybe its because they are so ferocious that they can be so kindanyways obviously i have been obsessed with the place ever since so i have done a lot of reading but i am definitely not as well informed as someone who is from there or at least better connected i am just some western dude with a crush on a valley', 'you cannot really make such smart plan at the moment flying into a country controlled by terrorists in a random plane hoping to even be able to land without being shot down by them the americans or either country on the way there what happens if they capture you too or just shoot the plane down what if they shoot it down after you have picked up the people and kill even more people who would not have died otherwise what happens when your plane is at 2000 capacity and you have people jumping on it desperate to get out even if you get out of there what will you do when you land in any country if you are even allowed and are told they are not welcoming migrants its already happened recently with migrants coming to europe

statement given by the uk defense minister to the news a few hours before the attack a very lethal attack could happen at kabul airport in a matter of hours armed forces minister james heappey has said mr heappey told sky news the grim reality is that intelligence has got ever more certain that an attack could take place at the afghanistan capitals airport or the handling centres being used to

little word of makebelieve you are a good person at heart and anything that upsets you about islam you immediately proceed to discredit as not being true islam because you have lived a watereddown version of islam all your life in reality it does not matter whether you believe that these people are true muslims or not or whether they are following the correct interpretation of islam in their minds they firmly believe they are muslims and doing the gods work muslims have been forever divided with regards to what constitutes true islam hence so many sects within islam at one hand you have millions of muslims that are currently grieving the fall of afganistan and praying for relief on the other hand you have millions of other muslims who are celebrating talibans triumph with pride go tell them they are not following the true islam i doubt they will listen to you', 'if someone complains about closed borders they are told it keeps the country safe if someone particularly a

wrong i agree with what you said but i am curious was not it better under american leadership than under the talibansnot really the country was at a total state of war and now there is atleast a little bit of peace plus the previous goverment was terrible and in big cities like kabul you could not leave your house at night because these big cities were full of criminals and gangsters who would kill you for even the smallest of things now the taliban provide more security plus now people are not in fear of getting drone striked in some places now there still are alot of downsides of the taliban rule its not good but in many cases some of which i mentioned they are better then the previous goverment but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are backi mean sure alot of things have gone downhill but as i mentioned above there are some cases in which a taliban rule is better and some cases in which a taliban rule was worse then the previous goverment the current humanitarian crisis is there because of the us for causing it and because of the taliban for not doing what the us says its kind off the fault of both to be honest but more of the us for not letting in and not legitimizingthe taliban and for women in big cities where afghanistan kind of got more modern yes things are worse for women there but in rural afghanistan not much has changed considering that there women have already followed the strict islamic rules without being forced to by the talibannow i am not wanting to depict the taliban in a good light hell no they are terrible but in some cases it was better then the corrupt and incompetent previous rule its kind of a pick your poison thing for afghans', \"great britain 2nd and 3rd reich

soviet unionmore like two events that are more than a decade apart and have nothing to do with oneanother the us showed itself far far worse here than in saigon and it is up against a power block that is much stronger than the soviet union was sure its possible that the us will get a facelift 15 years from now too but that is not too likely and if it does happen it will not be connected to its current failurescalling reagan good let alone one of the best is not only false it is borderline malicious considering what reagan did to the middle class in the us separate from foreign policy i know

concerned', 'let us be clear as an united states american who is well educated on history and science with a masters degree your statement is incorrect there is no difference in the extremism on any continent and all humans are suffering it is in different ways in different countries you are ignoring years of human suffering and abuse due to extreme political ideologies in the usa latin america southern american politics and canadian the following examples include american and canadian examples japanese american camps during world was ii the current child camps of illegal immigrates the trail of tears slavery and jim crow era laws causing segregation and creation of two societies the canadian government schools for first nationals the united states american civil war and so on while these two peoples comments are not as extreme as what the people in afghanistan are facing you are clearly ignoring or not educated about christian or political extremism in american politics i would advise you to look up the kkk the bombings of southern black churches in the united states in the 1960s extremist groups on the far left and far right and mass shootings that have interrupted

studies south asia as an anthropologist i will say what many indian muslims seem to want to say but are afraid of being labeled as terrorists since the indianleft has already tried to label me as a hindootuah should not it be hinduviyat so i guess i can return to neutrality by engaging in some muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations that aim to adopt innovations by incorporating them into their own frameworks instead of imposing western culture onto traditional peoples sound familiar', 'the old guys prefer india over china but the new gen prefer china because they all see china as this very rich very developed country from media only if they saw the other parts fo china their view would be different and see india as bully it all started because of economic blockade of nepal by india around 2014 i think due to low treatment of madhesi in terai regions by nepali government and at that time the chinese government gave them gas and food which swooned nepali towards china and the recent lipulekh land encroachment which nepali government used that topic to fuel the hatred towards india', 'that is what we do not understand real love will be a form of imitation.That person does not love

love for and his following of the prophet saw if you do not love the prophet saw then you do not love allah because you cannot love allah without loving that which allah loves.You cannot say you love allah and his prophet saw without following the prophet saw i know it comes across as wishy washy or extreme in nature but that is the truth.If you think that love does not have to involve imitation

assist by airdropping gunsresources or conduct airstrikes after they have widthdrawn all their american civiliansright now the taliabans have the americans by the proverbial balls at kabul airport as usa cannot be risking their citizens lives but the talibans are now seemingly trying to block access to the airport to american citizensif so then perhaps what the taliban is trying to do is buy time

is the worst thing you can doeven when prophet yonus as went to a village and spent a lot of time trying to tell everyone about islam the people never listened the prophet generalised the people and

more fond of their state or in afghanistans case their tribe but do understand the concept of a nation and that they are part of one', 'and since even lobbying the govt is not working because govt

us and germany slowed its aggression i doubt we would have entered the war at all', 'we did not run for our lives from the taliban they let us evacuate a shitload of afghans who worked to help us kill

fired lol not only that they pulled security for us and help escort some of those people to the airport i would not say the last month was really a show of strength from the taliban we have all seen the videos of them playing army they are pretty much as well trained as the average american you all qaeda member which is truly pathetic we held them at bay with a fraction of the fighting force took a fraction of the casualties they did and left the country in a completely defendable state which the ana squanderedbut yeah you are right dude sorry', 'yea apparently they want to talk but his demands are pretty clear and also steep so i cannot see it going anywhere there is rumors saying that he does not want a single taliban soldier in his home province or around it and basically make it an autonomous state with its own laws and rules which is something they will defiantly not budge on since that would basically cut them off from the north leading to dostums forces being able to retake it eventually well most likely getting unofficial support by him if they take the north that assumed mining deal with china goes up into smoke and so does the only way they could really make money', 'its the afghan people who are responsible for their own country especially when one nation pours trillions of dollars into the economy followed by every other nato nation that is poured billions into it as well stop with the excuses and the protesting at the white house because of the afghan men being too cowards to stay and fight against a hand full of taliban with ak 47s these afghan men had all the power equipment and even jets as well as the power to turn down unlawful orders yet they ran like the cowards they are this is what islam rule does to countries get rid of

has done as peace when a a bunch of people have committed to do bad things and use violence to do themyou cannot just have peace with them you have to have a bunch of other people who would probably rather not be using violence use violence in order for there to be peace i am just a dumb american but if there is a northern alliance forming to resist the taliban at least there is hope for the

allow alqaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control and he said us troops had been killing terrorists in afghanistan by the thousands and now it was time for someone else to do that work and it will be the taliban and it could be surrounding countries i really believe the taliban wants to do something to show were not all wasting time mr trump added if bad things happen well go back with a force like noones ever seen also later taliban leaders say they have changed since their harsh rule of the 1990s still seared in the memory of many and most of all afghan

posting this so masoud is calling on the coalition that fought off the taliban before to provide weaponry to his resistance force they have got enough for the shortterm but not a long civil war i hope the coalition can find a way to help it would be foolish to ignore this call now when afghanistan is on a precipice we have seen what the taliban has done in districts outside of kabul they are not

this as they otherwise seem normal but you really to be around them a lot to understand the burning hatred that powers their every thought and action the taliban literally has nothing comparable to

than a week overwhelming numerical superiority was not enough why do you think tanks would make any difference without modern intelligence a tank is simply a mobile artillery unit with a large target

exactly what happened there is no way we could have gone after the taliban in force without creating an international incident and literally invading surrounding countries like pakistan and iranwe did not think it through and just acted on emotion this is the way it was always going to end and we literally had former soviet generals telling us this before there was a boot on the groundwith that

beaten by the talibanshould the us have ever funded any in the first place maybe not but its much more complicated than this idea that the taliban al queda is our personal creation that we created so

believe that the face is not required to be covered the idea that women should speak quietly in public to avoid others hearing their voice is based on the idea that a womans voice is also awrah women being prevented from travelling or even essentially appearing publicly without a mahram the idea that entertainment and recreation is haram because it distracts from prayer and focus on islam while other muslim authorities also hold similar views entertainment and recreation are not completely banned and are allowed so long as they do not promote ideas that go against islamic norms and values the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas because of possible idolatry aligns with the actions that wahhabis have taken although its important to note not all salafis are wahhabist like the demolishing of various historical sites in saudi arabia the ban on women working sort of aligns with the salafi ideal that women should not be out working and making unnecessary contact with nonmahram men unless absolutely necessary the taliban take this to the next extreme by banning all women from work and failing to acknowledge those that had to work to meet the bare minimums for their families or were the sole breadwinners the ruling behind beards being mandatory and to not shave them while not specific to salafi ideology alone id say out of all the muslim groups they adhere to it the most strongly',

innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period', 'yes people have no idea how ruthless the isis he actually is they are so hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an

was the second highly disgusting rape that has come out of the region with the other being a frenchpakistani woman being gangraped on lahore highwaynon paywall link do not bother going to rpakistan to see it it hates religious minorities such as ahmedis and is a shithole of racism and xenophobia against afghans and even their own ethnicities balochis and sindhis they even had to delete many comments supporting the rape and defending and excusing their people who committed itislamabad pakistan a 5yearold girl in southern pakistan was raped hit on the head and set on fire five days later a woman in the countrys east was dragged from her car and sexually assaulted on a highway in front of her childrenthe two episodes which occurred hundreds of miles apart have prompted protests and an outpouring of rage in a country that critics say has a toxic culture surrounding sexual assaults and child abusehashtags calling for justice for the victims have been shared widely on social media by ordinary people opposition politicians and highprofile athletes including shan masood a member of pakistans national cricket teamwe cannot lose our youth to such disgusting and inhuman acts mr masood wrote on twitter keeping quiet is contributing to the issue we must stand up to these cowards and take actionpakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive waythere is a lot of indifference to such cases from pakistani officials said mehnaz akber aziz a member of the opposition in pakistans national assembly and a prominent childrens rights advocate there is no empathy only silence that is changing because the public is pushing backms aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns or villages and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media officials generally do not visit them either she said and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided lending a sense of impunity after the crimesyou are signaling to these people the rapists that its ok you can continue doing what you are doing and there will be a way out even if you are arrested she saidbut she said that the public rage over the girls killing was the largest groundswell of anger in a case of child rape and murder that she had seen on social media in recent memory outrage that has had the government scrambling to respondeditors picksthe girl was kidnapped last friday after going to buy cookies at a shop in the southern port city of karachi the police said her body was found two days later and an autopsy indicated that she had been sexually assaultedthe police have arrested more than 20 suspects in the case and investigators said on wednesday that one had admitted to kidnapping and murderin the second case the woman was driving late tuesday night with her three children from lahore the provincial capital of punjab province to the city of gujranwala when her car ran out of fuel she called the police and as she waited for assistance two men both believed to be in their 30s broke the driversside window with sticks and stones and dragged her and her children off the roadthe woman was raped multiple times and the men stole her atm cards jewelry and cash the police said the lahore police chief muhammad umar sheikh later said that an extensive search for the culprits was underwaybut the police chief also appeared to blame the woman for the crime questioning why she had been traveling late at night without an adult male companion and why she had not checked to see that her car had enough fuel for the journeythe backlash was swiftsocial media users writing under the hashtag motorwayincident several leading politicians television talk show hosts and celebrities called for him to be firedif a top police officer can openly engage in victim blaming imagine how junior policemen treat rape survivors ailia zehra a pakistani journalist wrote on twitter on thursday this is why women do not report sexual crimesshireen mazari the minister for human rights in prime minister imran khans cabinet condemned the comments by the police chief who serves in a province that is controlled by mr khans governing party nothing can ever rationalize the crime of rape she wrote on twitter that is itdr mazari did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on fridayreacting to both cases mr khan said in a series of tweets on thursday that officials would bring the perpetrators to justice such brutality and bestiality cannot be allowed in any civilized society mr khan saidpakistan ranks 147th out of the 182 countries that have ratified the un convention on the rights of the child according to an index on childrens wellbeing published by the kidsrights foundation a research and advocacy group in the netherlands the index measures the prevalence of child labor and rates of mortality and malnutrition among other criteriapakistans consistently poor ranking in the survey proves that policymakers and state machinery in pakistan have utterly ignored welfare and rights of children ms aziz the opposition lawmaker and childrens rights advocate wrote last year in the news international a major englishlanguage daily in pakistansome sexual assault cases in the country have led to calls for a national reckoningin 2015 pakistan was rocked by accusations that at least 280 children under the age of 14 in villages in eastern punjab province had been subjected to sexual abuse by a gang of 15 men who made videos to extort money from the children and their parentsmore recently the case of muhammad faizan an 8yearold boy who was raped and killed in the eastern pakistani city of chunian drew more outrage and protests people surrounded the local police station and accused officers of neglectthere are signs that the country is moving to tackle the issueunder legislation that parliament passed in march anyone who kidnaps rapes or murders a minor can face life imprisonment or the death penalty on friday ms aziz said that the measure should be the start of a broad array of reforms to promote child welfarebut to her knowledge ms aziz said no one had been prosecuted under the legislation so far', 'from what i gather as an outsider the government was extremely corrupt there was widespread harboring of pedophiles and government was generally divided on ethnic lines with the military being composed of groups who historically fought southern pashtuns as part of the northern alliance and who openly revere people who killed civilians in their offensives this means the afghan army feels like a foreign army to a lot of people in the south as they are speaking a different language and revere people they see as a historical enemy to their communitiesconsidering all that it is unsurprising if afghan civilians do not want to take up arms against the taliban even if they dislike the taliban there is not a viable alternative ready that is worth risking their lives for while the government itself seems to have given up with the people with actual military training fleeing or defecting it makes sense to just focus on protecting yourself and your family at that point taliban may even be better in at least some areas espicially if they can successfully transition to a peace time government without infighting war always has an extremely high cost but does not always lead to conditions improving', 'the americans did not leave much if any gear behind the ana did and what they had was not that good sure there was a guy flying a helicopter but flying one and coordinating combat operations with one is much more complicated unless the talibs get some serious supervision and training from the russians or isi etc that helicopter will be more dangerous to themselves than anybody they might try to use it against and sniper rifles have been in afghanistan for as long as there have been sniper riflesthe soviets could not do it in the 80s with their professional military heavy bombers and helicopter gunships the taliban could not do it in the late 90s when they had tanks and heavy artillery they still will not be able to do it if they try againa few outdated nvgs is not going to make the difference i mean if worse comes to worst all massoud and saleh have to do is collapse the entryway into the valleythe talibs have no heavy engineering equipment to clear the way like the soviets didit may be a different conflict but the more things change the more they stay the same', 'the army you trained and equipped to fight collapsed in days when you pulled its support literally thousands of americas had to flee through the gauntlet to the airport being beaten on the way some were shot thousands did not make it out and remain thereyour allies left behind are being executed and those that made it to the airport were literally throwing their babies over the wall to us troops pretty iconic photos one of those photos was of a female us soldier nursing a baby she is dead now killed by isis k along with a whole bunch of other us soldiers at that airport after that attack you stayed right where you were because you could not expand the perimeter you did not have the ability or permission from the talibanyou left with your equipment all left behind for the taliban akin to dunkirk you left tens of thousands of allies to die you did not secure the airport the taliban allowed you to use it to the 31st and on that day despite thousands of americans still being in the country you packed up and ran out minutes before the deadline because you knew if you stayed you would be slaughtered as they overran the airbase and the only possible defence would have been to bomb your allies trying to evacuate as the taliban flowed through them to overwhelm the perimeterthis is not a debate fella the whole world has watched it the us has been comprehensively defeated just like vietnamdefeated by an insurgency that had far more will to fight than you did that was not broken by air strikes over two decades because in isolation they do not work the definition of insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a different result', 'afghanistan has been through many changes in the last 6000 years even less than 3000 years ago it was a greek nation a lot has changed it was not just a static place of dueling tribes for its entire history proof the mongols absolutely took afghanistanproof the romans never tried to take it their borders never went further east than modern iraqthe russians could not take afghanistan that is true but arguably america did take it they controlled every province and every city the taliban became a rural insurgent movement the taliban was not created by the us to fight the russians the mujahideen were already in a state of armed conflict against the soviets and their puppet state when america armed them the taliban did not exist until 1994 after the soviet union had collapsed the taliban was actually hostile to the mujahideen armies and the northern alliance was a confederation of mujahideen armies opposed to the taliban most of the early taliban were actually refugees in pakistan being taught in religious schools funded by the saudis which is where they got their name which means students it would be most accurate to say they were created by the saudis and pakistan and that the united states at best contributed to their founding indirectly by being successful in defeating the soviets', 'they are free from religion is what they mean france is generally not a religious country anymore with many of its population not being affiliated to any religion anymore and again the only thing that is banned is the burka and even the majority of the muslim population here do not seem bother by it because the burka was not used here only by radicals and recent converts who by the time were only like 2000 women plus safety reasons and because the even a few times wanted criminals were found wearing them to get away from police not even joking still aside from the burka ban its alright to live here maybe the burka is a common clothing where you live but even amongst muslims in france belgium germany netherlands and spain its was a rare thing to see and believe me the could have gone worse but because the burka is seen as oppressive because it is enforced in saudi arabia and places like afghanistan taliban control the government allows other religious clothing also stop downvoting me you are not winning an argument by that lol', 'they just have different goals and different flavors of sunni fundamentalism i do not know why people in this thread are trying to apply labels like liberal to either of them the main difference is that is wants to destroy all currently existing nation states and fights both the gulf state monarchs as well as us and other imperial powers and they will brutally kill anyone who disagrees with them at all including other sunnis who make up the majority of their victims they are chaos agents and terrorists because that sort of fundamentalism and brute force thrives in a void and they wish to establish a caliphate all across the muslim world the taliban wants to act as an official government that implements their form of sharia law which yes includes basically turning half the population into slaves in the sense that women and girls will be entirely at the mercy of their fathers and husbands and will have no right in and of themselves everyone keeps focusing on what clothing they are made to wear and that they may not be allowed to work even though they are saying now that they will under some circumstances well see but that is a small aspect of it the majority of that country is rural in the first place the main thing is that they will be forced into marriages and have no right to appeal abuse in localities to any higher authority which leads to the sorts of atrocities that we see against women and girls all over the country sides of several nations in that region but the truth of the matter is that most of that was happening under former governments as well including under the afghan forces that the us backed and the various factions competing for power in different regions the taliban will be absolutely worse for middle class and urban women but if they could actually establish some real rule over the country it might be better for a lot of people in the countryside in any case that will not happen since there will be civil war instead and yes is which is worse all around will gain a foothold among the power vacuum as they do everywhere postus military action', 'you said the rlni would be arrested for doing the same but they are not governed by the same law as i a citizen under the queens peace is so that is why they can and i cannot legally speaking the mens rea you are waffling on about is overridden by amendments to the immigration act it used to be that you cannot help them for gain but now there have been many cases in which there has been persecution against people in my town that i know personally because they swam them onto english soil when they had slipped off their vessels the trouble is the difference between law the actual prosecution that happens just like its illegal to fox hunt on paper but we all know it happens all the time due to the way the law is written similarly it would be reasonable to think its perfectly fine to save someone from drowning but individuals in the water where its reasonable to believe that they are immigrants are not protected by the human rights actusually something like this would absolutely not be in the publics interest to prosecute except for the face that the gov etc do not want to set a precedent that you can all run into the sea saving all the immigrants unfortunately therefore make examples of those doing so there is also the issue of whether they ever were truly in peril its another loophole that has led to prosecution for doing this very thing one came off a dinghy but because they had a life jacket on the individual who helped was prosecuted the person had no idea they had a life jacket on until they got to them as it was not a high vis onein short just because your common sense which in some parts i even agree with andor legislation is there saying one thing it does not mean someone will not and is not prosecuted for doing so', 'i am an attorney who represents siv clients special immigrant visa which you can get if you assisted the united states we have been complaining for years that the siv approval process is way too slow anyways the pro bono organization my law firm partnered with had started talks about evacuating at least two months ago both people with siv approval and those whose applications were still pending since approval takes forever but we were told the situation would be stable for a few more months and so it never really got off the ground now obviously its chaos most of our clients are not in kabul and have no safe way to get to kabul or any other way out of their townvillage they are sheltering in place at least we hope we lost touch with several clients in the last few days for those in kabul we are trying to arrange transport out as you have seen in the news a lot of siv holders made it to fort lee va for those with siv applications still pending who do not yet qualify for a visa to the us we are trying to set up a temporary facility in qatar where people can wait safely but who knows what will happen it absolutely breaks my heart knowing many of our clients are probably already deadedit as you have probably seen in the news the us will try and bring 30000 siv applicants to the us unclear what that means or how they will accomplish it no plans at the moment for many of these applicants who do not live in or near kabul and have no way of getting to the kabul airport', 'i would not disagree in general but in this example funding a proxy war indirectly through another country pakistan it does not seem like a major message to me especially since it is hardly even known about to the average person it seems like it was an attempt to bleed the ussr dry and it helped a lot in that regardoppressing black impoverished americans and beating them in the streets and doing nothing to stop it other than giving police officers paid leave is more that speed imoand yes that is what i was getting at when i said the us was facing extinction and yes for better or worse but from the perspective of the people running the country during the cold war it was certainly for worse and for 99 of the country at the time it was for worse so with that said it only makes sense that the us would fund a proxy war against russia at the time given the blatant opportunityi get that that does not make it right morally but its the realistic option at the time for the us global politics is a dirty business when you are facing off with another global superpower and a lot was at stake', 'armenian invaders hilarious seeing that armenia has literally been on those

living it was interesting to see how he joined the taliban due to the atrocities he saw the mujahideen soldiers commit when he was a teenager in kabulin time however the mujahedeen came to him early one morning militiamen showed up in his neighborhood going house to house banging on doors ordering people out for inspections and taking whatever they likedjewelry embroidered cushions sometimes girls they plundered so meticulously that locals christened them gelam jam the rug collectors for it was said that when they looted your home nothing would be left not even the rugs after gelam jam took over a nearby street corner akbar gul stopped sleeping on the roofone afternoon he was in a crowd of pedestrians on his way to buy motorcycle parts when a man stepped out of an alley and blocked their path he was clutching a kalashnikov and his eyes shone crimson the stench of alcohol was unmistakable where are you going he shouted it was a gelam jam militiaman other gunmen stood farther back in the alley watching were just walking brother an elder said we are not part of this war the gunman stood glaring and then his gaze fell upon a group of burqaclad women get on the ground he yelled they did as they were told no one uttering a sound keeping his weapon trained on the crowd he walked over to the prone women and seized one of them she screamed and struggled and almost broke free ill kill you now if you do not shut up the militiaman snapped dragging her into a giant shipping container by the roadsideakbar gul kept his face to the asphalt and for a few moments everything was still then he heard a long shrill scream and looked up to see the woman burst through the container door her burqa was torn exposing a breast an elder ran to help a fighter leaned out of the shipping container and shouted we told you to stay down you dog and fired two rounds into him another fighter chased down the woman and hoisted her over his shoulders after returning her to the container he slammed the door shutat home akbar guls family was finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the city faced acute food shortages meals had become nothing more than stonehard daysold bread soaked in water and parceled out the smallest children and the elderly getting priority finally akbar guls oldest brother muhammad decided to brave the streets and head for the police precinct office to see if he might collect the salary he was owedhe did not return that afternoon the family waited into the evening but he still did not come back akbar gul spent the night in front of the house but he saw no sign of his brotherthe next afternoon as akbar gul was floating in and out of sleep he heard a knock on the door it was a neighbor looking nervous and uncomfortable he said to come quickly but would not explain why a sick feeling overcame akbar gul whatever it was he wanted to hear it first with his own ears finally he forced out the words did they kill himpray for his soul the neighbor answeredthe rest of the day was a haze of wailing women and visiting relatives even amid his tears akbar gul simmered inside muhammad had been the trailblazer in the family the first one to land a job the first one to marry he had done everything the right way while akbar gul had taken the easy path fate it seemed had picked out the wrong man gelam jam were killing the good ones the honest ones and it filled him with disgustlater that evening akbar gul learned that his brother and cousin had been stopped on a street corner and along with other militaryage males ordered to the wall in full sight of the passersby they were executedfor weeks akbar gul could hardly eat he spent his days in bed blaming himself for letting the two of them go the bitterness he felt was deep and growing in every militiaman who passed his window he saw the men who had ruined his family it felt as if god himself were taunting him sparing the wicked and condemning the just rewarding criminals like gelam jam and idlers like himself he had visions of living in a refugee camp in pakistan while gelam jam fighters occupied his home trekking through in their shoes spitting and hacking where they pleased bringing in people from the streets to do what they pleasedit was time for a change he would honor his brothers live by their example live an honest life he would stay behind guard the family home and help ensure that no one else suffered what his parents had but how all around him families were crumbling there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to itit did not matter what you thought whether you supported the mujahedeen or the communists the only households surviving unscathed he knew were the neighborhoods few uzbek families members of the same ethnic group as gelam jamhe was not interested in this war but the war seemed interested in him there were no more innocents no more neutrals only sides already chosen for him the choice was clear pick a side or end up like his brothers it would have been unthinkable before the war but now he felt he could trust only his fellow pashtuns they had borne the brunt of gelam jam in his neighborhood it seemed at first they had hidden their ethnicity speaking only farsi in public but soon they were getting plucked from their vehicles to have their pronunciation checkedand if their speech sounded pashtun they were often killed on the spot this was a war against people who spoke like him who looked like him and if that is what the enemy had decided then he would play by their rulesso one morning he went to a camp of hizbiislami a pashtunheavy militia

they are saying calling them non muslim makes them feel insulted tomorrow they will say calling ghulam mirza a false prophet offends them and after that they will say that saying that their teachings are not islamic offends them and if we will compromise on our basics then the door will open for many other forms of fitna and again you are forgetting that we are talking about qadianis or ahmedis who does not consider prophet s a w as last prophet and have their own holy books on which they put the label of islam and same mirza ghulam has said many disrespecting stuff about our mother the wifes of prophet s a w and many other prophets of allah and they consider us non muslims and you are saying something that does not make any sense you are missing the basic that what makes a person a muslim shadah of believing on allah and his last prophet s a w this is the base and anyone who does not believe in it he is a kafir or non muslim it does not require a degree to understand the difference and if someone declares himself as a muslim and believes in shahada then there is no problem he is a muslim like you and me we may have differences in understanding but we are both muslims and no one can label a person who believes in shahadah a non muslim which are also the prophet s a w and prominent scholars of all time and they day prophet s a w decalred his prophet hood all those following other religions became non muslims and muslims is specific word which defines a particular thing and if someone is so soft that they cannot hear the truth it is their problem', 'do not know if you saw this the taliban has yet to kill anyone in kabul and have implicitly stated that they will not be taking revenge taliban spokesman suhail shaheen told sky news thousands of schools would continue to educate girls as the group announced a general amnesty for those who previously worked in the afghan government saying their properties will be saved and their honor and their lives are safe a group of women staged a demonstration demanding the right to work and study in kabul on tuesday morning chanting the slogan join voices with us the small group of women approached a local taliban hq in khair khana district a suburb of northwest kabul but rather than arresting or beating the protestors the senior taliban commander present tried to reassure them by telling them do not worry your rights will be respected you will be allowed to work and study i would like to assure the international community that nobody will be harmed mujahid said from the former governments media information centre in kabul speaking into a row of microphones we do not want to have any problems with the international community he added before defending the talibans right to act according to our religious principles other countries have different approaches rules and regulations the afghans have the right to have their own rules and regulations in accordance with our values the spokesman suggested that the taliban intended to put the last 20 years behind them claiming that the group is not going to revenge anybody we do not have grudges against anybody we want to make sure afghanistan is not the battlefield of conflict anymore we want to grant amnesty to those who have fought against us he said', 'this is the exact reason why i did not matter of fact i gave you the truth and you chose to deny that said truth i defended my people and their honor and you choose to defile it and make fun of them people like you have done this to afghanistan for years on end and not just afghanistan but people of all groups and cultures you are part of the bottom of the barrel big boy its time to grow up and be a man face the facts and stop acting like a big boy you feed off of this kind of gamethe soldiers were explicitly told that a transitional government is taking place and an exchange of power is occurring the soldiers were ordered by the minister of finance to stand down and retreat to their bases and allow the taliban to come forth for negotiations and not to cause bloodshed when said time approached both the minister of finance and the president fled country america during the evacuation brought in a man named ali ahmad jalali who was the supposed new president in the transition the taliban rejected the man as he was part of the previous regime america then offered the taliban money in exchange for safe evacuation of their people biden then addressed the country leaving every detail out when you do not know the facts and refuse to acknowledge that this is what happened why should i bother to be rational with you it does not align with your logic big boy these men followed their orders in hopes for peace and the end of the forever war they did not know they would be stabbed in the back in addition the soldiers did not quit they did not receive payment for months no food no money nothing yet they all stayed and remained as soldiers while the corrupt government fed off of their money now you tell me who ran away big boy because all the men stayed while faced with poverty and hunger', '1st fragmentcameraman who hit you who hit youkhasha

there own game i have seen many senior ranking officers and diplomats of india who says if iran allow us a sustainable route to afghanistan we would have provided them air support even our oldest plans like a jaguar have capabilities to blow up taliban asses and we tried to support afghan forces by refurbishing there attack helicopter fleet but we need a sustainable route to reach afghanistan', 'did you forget the coalition that removed the taliban in the first place the world did help all the money to donations and government aid and the rats in the government ate it all us could have done a more hands on approach to rebuilding afghanistan and kept their puppets out of office but there is no point in wondering what could have beenactivism will not defeat the taliban but putting pressure on pakistan to stop supporting talib might besides that afghans are on their own the unfortunate truth is the world is tired of helping or hearing about afghanistan they are fine watching afghans drown while shouting from the sidelines after all what are they supposed to do take a flight to afghanistan and pick up a gunalso like the other commenter said you cannot rely on the ummah anymore the uyghers should be evidence for this look at how many islamic countries spoke out against china', 'it would be foolish to have a war pitting the two militaries against one another but that is not how india and pakistan relate anyway they play spy games with one another and both sides intelligence agencies support terrorist groups within the other country for shortterm goals the official governments of both countries look the other way when it suits their goals and try to prevent it causing internal conflicts which are sometimes violent when it does not the only people who gain ground over the long term are the terrorists themselves and its bigger than just pakistan there is a reason lots of indians go off to the gulf states to work but come back radicalized and this suits the hindu nationalists too since it gives them rallying cries and excuses for power expansions the way this conflict will unfold is not going to be about conquering lands but about internal strife between hindu fascists and muslim salafists that is going to destabilize the country meanwhile further privatization of everything and the dysfunction of the government will exacerbate the whole thing as there will be no safety net or state force to prevent the violence and the only way to have a nice life will be to try to live in gated areas in the metros and never leave that rich private bubble everyone else will be caught up in the crossfire of all this i think india is probably going to collapse into total chaos and sectarian conflict in the next 20 years but i am depressed so maybe i am wrong', 'why do you think the ummah should care the ideas and vicious thoughts that drive the taliban are popular amongst many they do not shout it out loud nor do they live by these atrocious ideas these terrorists preach but if they had to choose uswest in afghanistan or taliban they would all say taliban because they do not care for the afghan they just live in their bubble islam is getting attacked by all parties so let us support anyone rocking a beard and an ak47sorry to be so harsh but i lost all hope in this ummah they are blind and the hatred hypocrisy and greenness are deeply rooted into our minds seeds planted by our imams and muftis preaching hate for decades financed by a few rich states i am so sad to see what happens in afghanistan but just wait i will be attacked as a sinner because i prefer western intervention which granted women rights children a better future and men not to be canon fodder for taliban rant over my thoughts and prayers are with all afghan', 'islam is what you make it if you use hadith and verses our of context you get things like taliban that is what wahhabism teaches jihad in islam is against ones self struggle against satan and against an intruder when these taliban wahhabis kill innocent is that islam when they kill muslims is that islam men and women are seen as equals in front of god so when they restrict women to staying at home is that islam in islam education is encouraged taliban say education is not needed is that islam islam states men and women should dress modest taliban preach extremism and have an extreme definition is that modest is that islam islam has rules for war stating to not kill women children elders and to not destroy vegetation taliban parade about car bombings suicide bombings and destruction is that islamif taliban truly were preaching real islam no one would bat an eye taliban preach haram islam their version of islam which islam scholars disagree with if the scholars disagree with taliban then who are they bunch of bearded mountain khafir rats to impose islam when they do not know islam on video there are numerous examples of taliban not knowing the difference between sunnah and fardh they do not know mazhab they do not even know the kalimah on of the educated hot shot taliban said that panjshiri are not muslim lol can you believe that he also said if your not a taliban muslim then your not muslim you see taliban define islam in their own eyes as being something totally different than what it actually is they are equating their islam to gods words which is shirk is that islam if they do not know jack they are not the enforcers of islam they are puppets using islams name to commit crimes i am thankful to allah that i know the difference between right and wrong and if a taliban crosses my path its his end of days i have zero sympathy for someone that uses islam in a derogatory way our of context and make up their own version which is shirk islam is a religion of peace taliban are antipeace therefore they are anti islam and therefore islamic law does not apply to these coward animals if you disagree then please walk into any real mosque and educate yourself madrasa teach wahhabism and each of those animals learned in a madrasa', 'i have a genuine question why are afghans directing their hate towards pakistan considering it was usa that funded mujahideen now taliban to resist against the russian invasion and then usa waged war in afghanistan itself portrayed afg as a terrorist country in their media and films then left it absolutely ravaged i mean if anything pakistan seems to have been used by usa too considering its seen its generous share of terrorism and bombs i remember reading about this terrorist attack on an army school in pk in 2016 where taliban killed over 200 people including children and since the taliban takeover several reports from media outlets like bbc and al jazeera have shown how till date pakistan has taken in the most afghan refugees directing hate at pakistan almost seems like afghanistan wants a scapegoat because its too wimp to call out usa for its exploitations', 'and even if we do not know any taliban sympathizers us in the united states western democracies and free nations around the world also need to make our voices known in support of president saleh and the resistance against the taliban from the words of massoud himself yet we know that our military forces and logistics will not be sufficient they will be rapidly depleted unless our friends in the west can find a way to supply us without delayto that end i entreat afghanistans friends in the west to intercede for us in washington and in new york with congress and with the biden administration intercede for us in london where i completed my studies and in paris where my fathers memory was honored this spring by the naming of a pathway for him in the champslyses gardensknow that millions of afghans share your values we have fought for so long to have an open society one where girls could become doctors our press could report freely our young people could dance and listen to music or attend soccer matches in the stadiums that were once used by the taliban for public executions and may soon be againas the american thomas paine once wrote the heart that feels not now is dead the blood of his children will curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole and made them happythe best we can do is speak out on their behalf the leaders of our governments under enough pressure from the public can be induced to support a because as righteous and noble as this our efforts though little right now could be enough to save the republic of afghanistanafghanistan calls for aid the causes of liberty freedom and democracy around the world are at stake we must stand fast at her side and make sure that that free republic shall live to see another day for the sake of our consciences and for the sake of humanity atlarge', 'do not forget about the day to day thuggery for all their talk about islam at their heart the taliban have always had more in common with organized crime their big attraction was that for young men without much opportunity the taliban was a chance to get stuffthey could force people to hand over their daughters in order to provide their young men with wives most of the young men in the taliban were not good marriage prospects the only way they were ever going to get a woman was with a gun they could commit all manner of crimes ranging from rapes including children thefts murders and generally get away with it as long as their victims were not family members of other taliban which is why hazaras and other minority groups were frequently targeted when the world became aware of afghanistans problem with men preying on young boys it amazed me how nobody bothered to ask if the taliban perpetuated that', 'bro if you sit with balochis you would know they are called baloch it would be if i said i have many urdu friends instead of muhajir i been to balochistan in dec 2019 it was an extremely desolate place many netural human rights groups have stated thousands of people have been kidnapped and extrajudicially kileld by pakistani forces the most pro sepratist region which is the kech district has had their internet shut down for multiple years now something pakistanis were up in arms for when indian kashmmir has 4g internet cut out for a year punjab is an extremely rich province in pakistan which is why there high anti punjabi sentiment in balochistan it is easy to throw rocks at indian kashmir because your government has effectively brainwashed its people for multiple generations that they deserve the land when it became clear an invasion would not get it the narrative changed to we should give independence aka if i cannot have it no one should only people who legitimately care about oppressed people would not dismiss concerns in baluchistan as biased by the west and india there is a strong indepdence movement that has been there since inception lots of people escaped persecution and moved out of the country even then pakistani intelligence services murder these same people who espouse the same freedom sentiment as kashmiris sajid baloch karima baloch etc', 'to be honest i do not really watch afghan tv my parents and inlaws however watch it whole day its mostly just the news some cooking shows and then either turkish or indian shows which have been dubbed in either pashto or dari dubbed language depends on the channel we also have afghan idol talkshows strangely enough a lot of programs are based on music for example male andor female singers would be invited to talk and sing as far as i know they did not really show western shows sometimes they would show a hollywood or bollywood movie which would be dubbed over but you should know that afghanistan has always been an islamic country and quite strict so bare skin legs arms cleavage etc would always be blurred pictures of statues of indian gods which sometimes would be shown in indian shows did used to get blurred most of the times as well these shows are completely gone now there is a turkish show called kurulus osman which is about the start of the ottoman empire the taliban has approved this and it is showing at the moment', 'if anyone literally anyone shows some sort of a will to fight us army generals will put a massive pressure on biden to at least support those fighting the taliban with drones and f16snot necessarily as there is a problem there is no good route into afghanistan for those airstrikes the only good route is the fly over pakistan but that requires pakistans tacit approval meaning we go back to the same status quo of the last 20 years where pakistan is supporting both sidesflying missions out of turkmenistan uzbekistan or tajikistan might be doable but the logistics of that are tricky because it requires russian cooperation on top of that you probably need some kind of understanding with azerbaijan armenia turkey and possibly georgia for overflightnot to mention the us is not going to risk inflaming tensions with the taliban while hkia is surrounded once us personnel is out then maybe but not beforeif not him uk or australia will they are even more pissed off about how us handled the pull outnot remotely happening without us support the uk and australia have all of the problems the us has but they also lack a regional staging ground the closest they would have is diego garcia', 'they do control it but its only been a few daysthey wanted kabul more for the spectacle of it and the world wide coverage but its going to come at a costthey do not have resources to cover the whole country or manage it especially if what i am hearing they only have 60k total factions will regroup rise up and challenge them aka civil war upcomingthe taliban have the added burden now of having to govern and govern in a way that will keep the population happy a population that has had 20 yrs of western freedoms a generation that only knows these luxuries and a vastly better quality of life they had prior to the us invasion education jobs running water cell phones etc the taliban also will not have good sources of moneythey will be solely dependent on drug which is a lot but nowhere near the kind of they got from the us', 'you are welcome but i have to admit i am halfway talking out of my wrong end i spent a week in the panjshir valley back in 08 as an army medic tasked out to a navy seabee detachment that was doing inspection work on some construction projects the us was funding thereit was a wartime mission but i never felt so safe anywhere in afghanistan we drove up and down the valley and everywhere people were kind and welcoming we had candy and school supplies for the kids and they were so grateful even for things like pencils and papercontrast that with the burned out hulks of tanks and armored vehicles all over the lower third of the valley even up in the high places they use russian bomb casings as flower pots maybe its because they are so ferocious that they can be so kindanyways obviously i have been obsessed with the place ever since so i have done a lot of reading but i am definitely not as well informed as someone who is from there or at least better connected i am just some western dude with a crush on a valley', 'you cannot really make such smart plan at the moment flying into a country controlled by terrorists in a random plane hoping to even be able to land without being shot down by them the americans or either country on the way there what happens if they capture you too or just shoot the plane down what if they shoot it down after you have picked up the people and kill even more people who would not have died otherwise what happens when your plane is at 2000 capacity and you have people jumping on it desperate to get out even if you get out of there what will you do when you land in any country if you are even allowed and are told they are not welcoming migrants its already happened recently with migrants coming to europe hungary literally put a fence around the country to keep people away i am not being reckless about this brother ill do the legwork just help me raise funds stuff is already in motion', 'uk had contact with informers on the groundthey issued a warning a few days ago about an attack being planned but they did not know wherethen a few hours before the attack they got new intel that the attack was going to happen so the uk issued a firm warning to its citizens that an attack is possible to stay away from the airport and other places where westerner gather like the baron hotelthis was the statement given by the uk defense minister to the news a few hours before the attack a very lethal attack could happen at kabul airport in a matter of hours armed forces minister james heappey has said mr heappey told sky news the grim reality is that intelligence has got ever more certain that an attack could take place at the afghanistan capitals airport or the handling centres being used to assess refugees asked if an attack could happen in the next few hours he replied yes', 'as much as i feel bad for the situation in afghanistan i still am surprised by your naivety you live in your own little word of makebelieve you are a good person at heart and anything that upsets you about islam you immediately proceed to discredit as not being true islam because you have lived a watereddown version of islam all your life in reality it does not matter whether you believe that these people are true muslims or not or whether they are following the correct interpretation of islam in their minds they firmly believe they are muslims and doing the gods work muslims have been forever divided with regards to what constitutes true islam hence so many sects within islam at one hand you have millions of muslims that are currently grieving the fall of afganistan and praying for relief on the other hand you have millions of other muslims who are celebrating talibans triumph with pride go tell them they are not following the true islam i doubt they will listen to you', 'pakistan caught up with india economically i do not see indian government begging for loans the way pakistan has been forced to for small amounts like 12 billionv small on the scale of loans for countries indias economy is a 3 triton usd economy is projected to grow at 8595 while pakistan is projected to grow at 45india is known the world over for its it industry which has created a large growing middle class in india the future belongs to computing tech and india is well poised in that arenawhat is pakistans top export apart from wahabbi terrorism its cotton agricultural products pakistanis are not getting educated as much as in stem as they are getting educated in islam strategically pakistans long term islamic benefactors like saudi arabia uae have turned their backs on pakistan because it tried to ally with turkey to create another power center in the islamic worldwhere will the uneducatedunder educated pakistanis go when traditional destinations like saudi arabia uae are refusing entry to them pakistan does not have a large economy or growth prospects to absorb all these under educated young labourpakistan if it continues on this path is headed for a crash landing in the next few decades', 'do not get me wrong i agree with what you said but i am curious was not it better under american leadership than under the talibansnot really the country was at a total state of war and now there is atleast a little bit of peace plus the previous goverment was terrible and in big cities like kabul you could not leave your house at night because these big cities were full of criminals and gangsters who would kill you for even the smallest of things now the taliban provide more security plus now people are not in fear of getting drone striked in some places now there still are alot of downsides of the taliban rule its not good but in many cases some of which i mentioned they are better then the previous goverment but it seems to me that things really took a turn for the worst especially for women since the talibans are backi mean sure alot of things have gone downhill but as i mentioned above there are some cases in which a taliban rule is better and some cases in which a taliban rule was worse then the previous goverment the current humanitarian crisis is there because of the us for causing it and because of the taliban for not doing what the us says its kind off the fault of both to be honest but more of the us for not letting in and not legitimizingthe taliban and for women in big cities where afghanistan kind of got more modern yes things are worse for women there but in rural afghanistan not much has changed considering that there women have already followed the strict islamic rules without being forced to by the talibannow i am not wanting to depict the taliban in a good light hell no they are terrible but in some cases it was better then the corrupt and incompetent previous rule its kind of a pick your poison thing for afghans', 'in the 70s they were embarrassed in 1975 in saigon then jimmy carter was one of the worst foreign policy presidents ever but then regan came in and was arguably one of their best modern foreign policy presidents and helped dissolve the soviet unionmore like two events that are more than a decade apart and have nothing to do with oneanother the us showed itself far far worse here than in saigon and it is up against a power block that is much stronger than the soviet union was sure its possible that the us will get a facelift 15 years from now too but that is not too likely and if it does happen it will not be connected to its current failurescalling reagan good let alone one of the best is not only false it is borderline malicious considering what reagan did to the middle class in the us separate from foreign policy i know but even then i would argue that his successes were mostly just the ussrs failures in the cold war the us was much stronger than the ussr the opposite is soon to be true now where russia and china are concerned', 'let us be clear as an united states american who is well educated on history and science with a masters degree your statement is incorrect there is no difference in the extremism on any continent and all humans are suffering it is in different ways in different countries you are ignoring years of human suffering and abuse due to extreme political ideologies in the usa latin america southern american politics and canadian the following examples include american and canadian examples japanese american camps during world was ii the current child camps of illegal immigrates the trail of tears slavery and jim crow era laws causing segregation and creation of two societies the canadian government schools for first nationals the united states american civil war and so on while these two peoples comments are not as extreme as what the people in afghanistan are facing you are clearly ignoring or not educated about christian or political extremism in american politics i would advise you to look up the kkk the bombings of southern black churches in the united states in the 1960s extremist groups on the far left and far right and mass shootings that have interrupted civilians lives in schools work places and other public the united states government also has medical tested and lied to african americans citizens about their health status to see the long term effects of syphilis the tuskegee study', 'indianamerican hindu here who speaks reads and writes fluent urdu arabic and farsi also fluent hindi and german bad spanish and very basic sanskrit and studies south asia as an anthropologist i will say what many indian muslims seem to want to say but are afraid of being labeled as terrorists since the indianleft has already tried to label me as a hindootuah should not it be hinduviyat so i guess i can return to neutrality by engaging in some muslimtva the taliban of the 90s is almost completely dead the current generation of fighters are mostly between 1530 which means that many of them were born after the war some of the younger recruits have never seen the original taliban back in the 90s they used to consider it a sin to take a photo of any animate living being ie humans and animals so seeing the leadership appear on tv would have been unthinkable back thenso where did the 80000 fighters come from and what changed most of the current fighters were recruited from the families friends and neighbors of the many innocent people that were killed or injured by bomb blasts drone attacks and ontheground shooting in the 2000s especially there were a lot of soldiers that would disrespect and humiliate villagers and torture random innocent people including children this torture included things like peeing on people threatening to rape their sisters and threatening to massacre their village if they did not give up information i know a veteran that did this once again this happened to children too the taliban ideology was wildly unpopular even in kandahar the lack of womens rights resulted in numerous uprisings and protests forcing the taliban to loosen restrictions so over time as taliban fighters were being killed in the 100s by massive bombings the new recruits joined to get rid of the foreign army that was constantly humiliating and disrespecting people and forcing them to live in fear for no reason it was like they were being punished for being afghans or as they see it for being muslims these guys used islam as a rallying force because it maintained hope these guys come from some of the poorest communities in asia and they were fighting against a world superpower that was deploying a multitrillion dollar military industrial complex against them and did not think twice about massacring them by the thousands now that the foreign troops are leaving they no longer have any reason to keep fighting the original mullahs are basically still there but they are probably tired of having to stay one step ahead of the global manhunt that was looking for them now it looks like they realize that their membership is totally different and many of them have no interest in becoming the new bad guys that want to kill random innocent afghans when they say that they want womens rights within the confines of islam or within islamic frameworks or within our cultural frameworks they want womens rights to be employed in a way that is framed within afghan culture ie in a way that does not punish these guys for not being afghans the whole reason for the mujahideen was that the communists came there and tried to force them to change their culture and told them that their religion was a book of stories from arabia these guys are religious but their law system is dictated largely by their ancient tribal customs that are worked into an islamic framework islam is also open to interpretation and there are islamic feminist movements hence the we have frameworks for this basically the taliban went from being a terrorist organization to being something that we see a lot today in india organizations that aim to adopt innovations by incorporating them into their own frameworks instead of imposing western culture onto traditional peoples sound familiar', 'there is a huge contingency one of the mods of reuropeansocialism got suspended from reddit over a disinformationfilled post that called for solidarity with the taliban it was stickied and full of people supporting the ideai am honestly not involved with that subreddit so i am not sure what they are about but i would say that there are alot of subreddit that are cosplay socialists so they might be one of those many ml subs overwhelmingly dennonuce the talibanlook i am glad that there are a ton of mls who do not but there are a ton of mls who arei would not say that there are many mls that support taliban like i said they go against everything ml stand for are you kidding me they have killed several thousands of people in the last month or so and they are regularly shooting civilians right nowyou got to see things in context in comparison to what would have been they have been relatively unopposed in taking powerthat depends on what you mean by support cubaoppose the embargo and support self determination for the people of cuba that i agree with support a totalitarian government neverfrom my conversation with cubans in cuba the government is not repressive at all they fully support them i mean cuba has survived embargoes and many attempts from america at inciting a colour revolution the government must be doing something right if they can weather such intense pressure from external forces like i said i am not going to argue with you on this but just my final word on it', 'calling reagan good let alone one of the best is not only false it is borderline malicious considering what reagan did to the middle class in the us separate from foreign policy i know but even then i would argue that his successes were mostly just the ussrs failuresyou literally contradict your entire point here lol i am strictly talking about foreign policy no need to shoe horn other aspects of his presidency that i am not talking about into the conversationthe overall point is that in 79 the us looked like a joke on the world stage saigon was 4 years before and jimmy carter was bumbling the iran hostage crisis one president later they were leading the movement to dismantle the iron curtain if you are seriously not going to give reagan credit for that you are just a disingenuous reagan haterthe us is always one president away from pulling a 180 its a design feature for their system if foreign policy is embarrassing them internationally they typically elect a guy with the goal of improving that area likewise with other issues which usually creates diametrically opposed leadership and policy every 48 years', 'but taliban will make a cut and draw a new budget if they cut state spending it can work it worked in middle age in feudal society people are forced to grow food you take some food from them and give the food to your blacksmiths to forge weapons you use the weapons to keep the population under control overy simplified but it is how it is drop in divine script and rigths and laws for improved control effect taxes do shuffle money around but there is domestic product it is possible to have a cpntained economy it would be very poor one but still we are not considering that they will be a normal state do we they sat once at the table with cheney and obviosly could not agree on the amount puf six months later they were gone we see what happens now', 'the reasons keep changing one day its for women rights one day its due to 911 and because the region is a terrorist hub bla bla biden denies he went there for nation buildinghuh we entered afghanistan in 2001 under bush like biden said in the article you posted we went there to get bin laden and wipe out alqaeda how do the reasons for the initial invasion keep changingx 200ball i am saying is we are at square 1 and even worse off because the us did not achieve any of its ever changing goalsyeah i do not think anyone disagrees with you on that we can lay waste to conventional armies but not so great at what comes afterx 200blet me pose a scenario to you does it make sense to go to war with germany in 1941 kill hitler and then withdraw and let the nazi regime continue its terrors of course not it was waged to oppose the taliban al qaeda ideologies and the threat emanating from thegermany did not have an active and wellorganized insurgency constantly fighting us for 20 years if it did i would not be surprised if we withdrew from germany also we did not go to war with germany because of the holocaust or nazi war crimes details about the holocaust did not even come out until near the end there was plenty of progermany support in the us if japan had not directly attacked the us and germany slowed its aggression i doubt we would have entered the war at all', 'we did not run for our lives from the taliban they let us evacuate a shitload of afghans who worked to help us kill them in droves over the last twenty years after the ana decided to not fight them we landed 5000 troops uncontested in their capitol and took over their only international airport without a shot being fired lol not only that they pulled security for us and help escort some of those people to the airport i would not say the last month was really a show of strength from the taliban we have all seen the videos of them playing army they are pretty much as well trained as the average american you all qaeda member which is truly pathetic we held them at bay with a fraction of the fighting force took a fraction of the casualties they did and left the country in a completely defendable state which the ana squanderedbut yeah you are right dude sorry', 'xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping xi jinping

of it is under the agreement the militants also agreed not to allow alqaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control and he said us troops had been killing terrorists in afghanistan by the thousands and now it was time for someone else to do that work and it will be the taliban and it could be surrounding countries i really believe the taliban wants to do something to show were not all wasting time mr trump added if bad things happen well go back with a force like noones ever seen also later taliban leaders say they have changed since their harsh rule of the 1990s still seared in the memory of many and most of all afghan women this process will test the taliban but also veteran afghan leaders of the past and a new generation which has come of age in the last two decades and is hoping against hope for a different future in december 2018 the militants announced they would meet us officials to try to find a roadmap to peace but the hardline islamist group continued to refuse to hold official talks with the afghan government whom they dismissed as american puppets', 'it will not be monumentus but look at it a different way firstly there will be an awareness increase that is an easy one but additionally think of the afghans in amsterdam and holland in general they may feel more supported particularly if they still have family there peoples actions towards because support are often heavily judged as though you either have to solve the problem or do nothing its ok to contribute to any effectsunfortunately in my experience people who are most likely to criticise protests marches or whatever else which do not have a direct effect are the least likely to do anything at all this may not be you and sorry to imply thatedit another example imagine being even in afghanistan and seeing that cities around the world are watching supporting and flying a flag you can no longer fly yourself that is got to feel good does it solve the problem obviously not i doubt anyone at this march feels like they are fixing the issueedit 2 fixed a few words which made no sense', 'actually alot of them were our friends a group of kids would stop people from throwing rocks at us when we drove through a village several times because they would come watch us when we did foot patrols and wed spend tons of time joking around with them and hooking them up with candy and shit kids who worked on our outpost picking up trash and stuff often got gifts from soldiers they knew well one kid got an rc helicopter from a guy for ramadan we found one kid that was being seriously abused gave him a job and he lived on our outpost for a year and ended up being adopted by my commanding officer we very much developed a relationships with people in the areas where they were not entirely hostile to us', 'i do concede that it is not entirely untrue to say that there is a bit of propaganda in a very loose sense of that word to paint the royals in a good light but i think this is justifiable because firstly people on average are not very bright and often lack coherence look at the current state of most true democracies in the world if you do not believe me so in the long run they may lack forsight and often because a distruption to the flow of progress due to civil unrest you may argue that such disruptions due to civil unrest are not as bad as i believe them to be and are infact quite necessary this may be true for other countries but for a tiny country like bhutan lodged between two giant and sly nations any form of civil unrest must be avoided or properly diffused in order to protect our sovereignty so i believe a propaganda is required to unify the opinion of the masses on certain topics', 'if macau which was a land technically never supposed to be fully portuguese sovereign territory since it was a sui generis small patch of land where portuguese were allowed to live and trade with the chinese for instance once the qing conquered the ming the qing imperial mandarins replaced the ming imperial mandarins in macau that was peacefully handed over to the chinese authorities after mutual beneficial bilateral negotiations is considered to be Chinese-occupied and should instead be either portuguese again or independent surely these same people will consider goa 1 a territory unreservedly part of portugal for close to half a millenium 2 that had been part of portugal for longer than any other indian polity that we know of 3 that remained portuguese as a hundred indian polities elsewhere rose up and collapsed was forcibly invaded and directly integrated contrary to macau no special autonomy was granted and instead was initially centrally ruled by non-native indians', 'exceptthe us does not gain a relative advantage from 30k personal and 15k paid contractors in japan a much smaller presence would suffice for leverage and intelligence i see the value in keeping bases around europe and asia but there is also value in preventing global terrorism the likes of which we saw so much of around the new century not only that we can certainly expect to see such a nation as china step into the void we have left to further their goals and whether direct confrontation with the us is on the table is not as relevant as checking chinas rapidly growing influeceyou cannot measure everything purely in benefits you have to include the harm and while i am not honestly advocating for more troops to the middle east i am saying there will be major negative consequences to the us and its allies because of this that could have been mitigated we have gambled now but i think where world standing is concerned its a bad hand', 'i feel as ok as a person should be at a time like this i am losing sleep so maybe i am going crazy and last to noticei should maybe add to the average person in the us the title of this topic can easily sound like russians are back in afghanistan in which case they panic as though they have

the emotion that led to the events i mean i joined the army over it i was 19 when 911 happened in hind sight it was an overreaction and ill thought out do not get me started on iraq we should have stuck to socom operations to root out bin laden and provided air supporttraining with the northern alliance we never should have occupied that country it simply is not worth it being bound by the geneva convention the taliban could just slip away cross border and avoid us until we left which is exactly what happened there is no way we could have gone after the taliban in force without creating an international incident and literally invading surrounding countries like pakistan and iranwe did not think it through and just acted on emotion this is the way it was always going to end and we literally had former soviet generals telling us this before there was a boot on the groundwith that said i get it and understand how it all unfolded i just wish our government was capable of being more objective and level headed at the time than the populace', 'the requirement of wearing a burqa in public aligns with salafi ideas that women have to cover their face in islam as well compared to other muslims who believe that the face is not required to be covered the idea that women should speak quietly in public to avoid others hearing their voice is based on the idea that a womans voice is also awrah women being prevented from travelling or even essentially appearing publicly without a mahram the idea that entertainment and recreation is haram because it distracts from prayer and focus on islam while other muslim authorities also hold similar views entertainment and recreation are not completely banned and are allowed so long as they do not promote ideas that go against islamic norms and values the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas because of possible idolatry aligns with the actions that wahhabis have taken although its important to note not all salafis are wahhabist like the demolishing of various historical sites in saudi arabia the ban on women working sort of aligns with the salafi ideal that women should not be out working and making unnecessary contact with nonmahram men unless absolutely necessary the taliban take this to the next extreme by banning all women from work and failing to acknowledge those that had to work to meet the bare minimums for their families or were the sole breadwinners the ruling behind beards being mandatory and to not shave them while not specific to salafi ideology alone id say out of all the muslim groups they adhere to it the most strongly', 'last post because you are a very irritating individual and its not my job to teach youespecially when you are paying 9000 a year yet you are still wrong loli do not know why you

hardcore they actually left the salafist folds of islam even the most hardcore salafi scholars openly denounced them many paid with their lives at this point their focus is just on killing they see jihad as a way of salvaging their lives and getting the promised paradise which is ironic because for their goals they would kill anyone and everyone and commit such atrocities even the devil would be surprisedthe real reason they are dangerous is because they just follow their hardcore literalist teachings they have no reason they do not the taliban want legitimacy so they are trying not too because too much damage and atleast appearing moderate they are willing to form negotiations and treaties and actually working towards some common ground even though by the world standards its pretty much backwards and lame to put it this way if it were the isis capturing the kabul there would have been thousands of casualties i do not support the taliban but if there was an isis threat i would beg the taliban to take them down so we can focus on fighting and destroying the taliban later on and not worry about an enemy that does not care for anyone']\n",
